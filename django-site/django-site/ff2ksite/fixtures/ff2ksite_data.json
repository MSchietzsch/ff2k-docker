The tea he sipped to clear his tight throat was bitter, corrupt. The house-elf did his best, he always did, especially on particularly significant days, but Harry was physically unable to enjoy the elf's offerings. No solace found in food. Not even Ginny Potter, his best source of comfort, could ease the sorrow that weighed heavily on his soul, dragging him into a depression that did not allow him to eat, to drink, to make love. Not today.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"1\">The three people in the dining room could not pretend, as they normally attempted to, that their broken hearts would heal someday. Ginny played with her food, pushing it around and around her plate without taking a bite. She stared aimlessly at it, her head bowed as though in prayer. Ron Weasley did not even attempt to create an illusion that he was eating. He slouched in his chair, his arms folded across his chest. Harry could see the muscles in his jaw working as he ground his teeth, and his nostrils flared every once in a while as though he was on the verge of tears.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"2\">\"Shall I get the firewhisky?\" Harry asked quietly. \"I bought the best. For tonight.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"3\">\"Might as well,\" Ron said tonelessly. Ginny only nodded, her eyes closed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"4\">Harry stood. He could have used magic to Summon the bottle, but felt a restlessness. He crossed the room that, despite Kreacher's best efforts, was as dismal and gloomy as Grimmauld Place had been. His mind skittered away from that thought, though; despite the gloom of the Black residence, he'd had good times there as well. Remembering the good times made his stomach churn like acid even more than remembering the bad.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"5\">There were no photographs anywhere in the house, except in the album Hagrid had given Harry so many years before. There were no cheerful waves coming from dead people to deepen the sorrow. Harry had packed up the pictures himself &ndash; it had seemed too much for Ginny and Ron, to see their family smiling up at them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"6\">\"&mdash;Harry?\" Ginny's voice cut through his thoughts. He turned toward her.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"7\">\"Yeah?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"8\">\"You were just standing there&hellip;\" He saw understanding in her brown eyes. He didn't know where or who he'd be without her. He'd most likely be dead. They'd been married for almost three years; they'd married only months after the Battle for Hogwarts, clinging to each other with only Ron at their side. Flitwick, the Headmaster of Hogwarts and one of the few survivors from the Battle, had officiated through tears.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"9\">\"I know, I'm sorry.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"10\">He ended up Summoning the bottle anyway, and three shots later he almost felt numb.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"11\">\"They'd hate what we're doing,\" Ron said unexpectedly. Harry had lost track of how much of the bottle he'd gone through, but he wasn't his best mate's minder. Ron only talked about them when he was drunk.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"12\">\"I know,\" Ginny said. \"But we do what we can.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"13\">\"Hermione,\" his voice cracked, and he rubbed his chin. \"She'd kick our arses.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"14\">\"She would,\" Harry agreed. He'd give quite a lot to have his dead friend kick his arse.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"15\">\"Fred and George would be &ndash; they would be t-terrible,\" Ginny tried to smile, but it came out a bit lopsided, and disappeared almost as soon as it arrived.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"16\">\"Your mum and dad would have to give us stern talking-tos,\" Harry reached over and grabbed his shoulder with the hand that was not holding his firewhisky. \"Your mum especially.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"17\">\"Dad would be &ndash; he'd be in the kitchen, looking at the Muggle stuff while Mum yelled at us.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"18\">\"Percy would be reading us the riot act, telling us we're not being good role-models, and that we were disgracing the name of Weasley.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"19\">\"Meanwhile, he'd be scheduling interviews &ndash;&nbsp;<em>after&nbsp;</em>he got rid of all the bottles of firewhisky in the house,\" Ron finished when Ginny's voice faded. Her face was set, her jaw clenched tight, and she gripped Harry's hand fiercely.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"20\">\"Fleur'd be so angry with us that she'd be screaming at us in French,\" Harry put in. The firewhisky burned his throat and made it easier to talk. \"And Bill would curse us so badly that we'd be old and gray by the time it lifted.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"21\">\"Charlie would set dragons on us,\" Ginny offered. \"You know he would.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"22\">But they were all gone,&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>of them.&nbsp;<em>A demolished hall stacked with bodies and washed with blood.&nbsp;</em>Harry shook his head impatiently. They were sleeping in the ground, unaware of the lonely and bitter victory and the pain their deaths had caused. If Harry had known he was a Horcrux sooner, if he had given himself up before the slaughter&hellip;</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"23\">\"Stop it, Harry,\" Ginny and Ron said in unison. \"We know what you're thinking,\" Ginny added. \"It&nbsp;<em>wasn't your fault</em>.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"24\">\"I-I-I just &ndash;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"25\">\"I know,\" Ginny said, voice gentle. \"But lay the blame where blame is due.&nbsp;<em>Voldemort&nbsp;</em>killed them.&nbsp;<em>Bellatrix&nbsp;</em>killed them.&nbsp;<em>Dolohov&nbsp;</em>killed them. And you killed those who stole our family away.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"26\">\"Only once,\" Harry said bitterly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"27\">Ron blew out a deep breath, took another shot, and squeezed his eyes closed. \"I'm going to miss them. Always and always.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"28\">\"Always and always,\" Harry and Ginny echoed.&nbsp;<em>Always and always&nbsp;</em>was a phrase that had initially begun with Harry's proposal to Ginny. It had not been romantic. One solid month of funerals, and the love he'd felt for her was the only thing keeping him sane.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"29\">\"<em>Ginny,\" he whispered as they lay with arms wrapped around each other. They'd just woken up. Mornings had been difficult then &ndash; in that first moment of wakefulness it was easy to forget that victory looked an awful lot like defeat.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"30\"><em>\"Harry,\" she murmured against his chest.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"31\"><em>\"I can't live without you,\" he said simply. \"I wouldn't survive.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"32\"><em>\"Me either,\" she sighed.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"33\"><em>\"I'm going to love you,\" he said. \"Always and always. Will you marry me?\" It had been the best he could do. They'd reunited after a year of fruitless searches for the Horcruxes, and an open attack on the Burrow. Harry had realized, standing in the rubble, horrified, that despite his best efforts, Ginny and her family would always be targets. He hadn't wanted to lose her without her knowing, everyday, that despite time and distance, she was the best part of him. They'd been hopeful. After another year of Ginny in hiding with her family, and frequent visits, Harry had decided that as soon as he'd taken care of Voldemort, he would put a ring on her finger and never let her go. He'd had daydreams of how he'd ask her. Possibly in the Gryffindor common room, or on a Quidditch pitch. He'd do something romantic &ndash; he'd ask Hermione to help him.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"34\"><em>But it was not to be.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"35\">It had become a catch phrase, and they'd both said it in the vows they had made to each other on a lonely hill covered in heather. It had struck a chord in Ron, though they hadn't been aware of it for months.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"36\"><em>It was Christmas day, and grief had raged inside while a storm raged outside. A day that should have been happy. But when each person had lost everyone else they had ever loved, that was impossible. They'd found solace in wine.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"37\"><em>\"I'm going to miss them,\" Ron said. \"Always and always.\" He was not so drunk that he was completely unaware that he had usurped words that were special to Harry and Ginny, and his face fell into apologetic lines. \"I'm sorry, I &ndash;\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"38\"><em>\"No,\" Harry said firmly. He shared a glance with Ginny. \"It fits.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"39\"><em>And it did. Always and always meant him and Ginny. But it also meant him and Ron, and the past they shared. It meant Ron and Ginny, the only survivors of a large family, more fragile than any of them had ever dreamed. It meant the wounds that would always, always be there, and it meant the love they would always, always feel for those they'd lost.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"40\">They sat in silence for a good hour, and Harry was sure that he was not alone in his thoughts. Ginny had scooted her chair closer to Harry; their shoulders brushed. He wanted to hold her, bury himself inside her until he lost himself, but it was the anniversary of everything they had lost, and Harry didn't think he could make love to her if he tried.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"41\">\"I wish we had Hermione's Time-Turner,\" Ron said absently, his voice hoarse. \"I wish we could go back, I wouldn't have been incapacitated by that effing curse. I could've protected them, maybe&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"42\"><em>\"This is a Time-Turner, Harry,\"</em>&nbsp;Hermione's voice echoed from the past, and Harry was struck by a thought so wild and insane that he knew he was even drunker than he'd thought. He tried to stop it, tried to pretend it hadn't occurred to him, but the ludicrous idea gripped him tightly. He opened his mouth, but no words emerged.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"43\">\"Harry?\" He could hear the alarm in Ginny's voice. He must look wild; he&nbsp;<em>felt&nbsp;</em>wild. He had the urge to laugh.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"44\">\"What if we could?\" He asked. \"What if we&nbsp;<em>could</em>?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"45\">\"Could what?\" Ron gaped at him. Not surprising, that, Harry could not remember feeling so driven. Not since they'd lost everything but each other on the field of battle.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"46\">\"What if we could go back in time?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"47\">\"Harry&hellip;\" Ginny sighed. \"It isn't possible. It isn't. Time-Turners can only go back a few hours, you&nbsp;<em>know&nbsp;</em>that. You're drunk, we should go to bed.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"48\">\"No,\" Harry said forcefully. \"We should think about this, we have to!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"49\">\"You're mental, mate,\" Ron said flatly. \"Mental. You shouldn't even be thinking about this, it isn't healthy.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"50\">Harry's laughter sounded eerie even to his own ears. \"The way we live isn't healthy, Ron. It's been three years, and we haven't done a damn thing since it happened. We're&nbsp;<em>old</em>&nbsp;and we're only twenty-four. We're barely breathing, the three of us. If you two weren't here, I probably would've committed suicide ages ago.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"51\">Tears stood out in Ginny's eyes. \"But Harry&hellip; it's&nbsp;<em>impossible</em>, what you're thinking.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"52\">\"How do you know?\" Harry asked belligerently. \"Maybe people have done it, they just never talked about it.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"53\">\"What, we're going to build a super-powerful Time-Turner?\" Ron asked. \"Go back in time and save everyone while remaining hidden? What could we possibly change?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"54\">\"Everything,\" Harry said. \"Everything. We've got to&nbsp;<em>try</em>, damn it!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"55\">\"Harry, we have all these memories of living without them,\" Ginny said. \"Three years worth of memories. If we really did go back in time, we'd already know it. They'd be alive.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"56\">\"Not unless we changed Fate,\" Harry said. \"We'd have different memories. We'd be at the Burrow right now, celebrating our victory, not wallowing in the price we paid to have it.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"57\">Ron and Ginny exchanged looks.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"58\">\"Listen,\" Harry said, growing frustrated. \"Ron, wouldn't you want your&nbsp;<em>wife&nbsp;</em>back? Ginny, wouldn't you want to live in a world where your family still breathed?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"59\">\"That's cruel,\" Ginny said softly, but Harry could tell that she was thinking about it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"60\">\"I'm sorry,\" he said, though he wasn't. He felt almost alive again; he felt the way he did when he made love to Ginny or flew around the countryside with Ron. He felt like he had a purpose. It may not be possible, but he could at least&nbsp;<em>try</em>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"61\">\"I think Hermione might've mentioned something once,\" Ron said tentatively, his eyes growing distant. \"It was the morning after you guys rescued Sirius. She talked about how Time-Turners were the most reliable way to travel through time.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"62\">\"And if a Time-Turner is the most reliable, then there've got to be unreliable ones,\" Harry said. \"We can look into that tomorrow, after we talk to Dumbledore's portrait.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"63\">\"We're going to Hogwarts?\" Ginny asked. Harry knew what she was thinking. They hadn't gone back since the morning after the battle; the rubble had not been cleared away, and the bodies had still been in the Great Hall.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"64\">\"Yes,\" Harry said.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"65\">\"Dumbledore would know if there was anything we could do,\" Ron said.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"66\">Harry felt strange, to say the least. For three years, misery had been eating away at him, at all of them. It was odd to have a purpose again. \"I think&hellip; I really do think there's a way.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"67\">His madness had affected Ron and Ginny, he noticed. It took a moment for him to recognize the look on their faces. They looked hopeful for the first time in years.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"68\">HPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHP</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"69\">Dawn came early the next day, and Harry's sleep had been deep; he had not had a single nightmare. When he awoke, he tossed back one of the bottles of Auntie Jigg's Hangover Remedy that Kreacher had placed on the bedside table sometime during the night, and leapt from the bad. By the time he washed, Ginny was awake and looking the same way he felt: stunned and purposeful. Why had they not thought of this before? They could've already changed everything!</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"70\">Ron met them in the sitting room not ten minutes later, his hair still dripping from his own shower. He was not moving like an Inferius anymore, and he almost looked like the old Ron, the Ron that Harry'd gone to Hogwarts with, before the death of his wife, parents, and brothers had turned him into a hollow shell.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"71\">Harry grinned. Ron looked gobsmacked.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"72\">\"We're really doing this, then?\" Ron asked. \"We're going to try?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"73\">\"We are,\" Ginny said firmly. \"We are.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"74\">They left the house together, and Harry was once again surprised by how&nbsp;<em>good&nbsp;</em>it felt to leave it for a reason other than the few necessities that Kreacher could not acquire for them. They'd become recluses, Harry thought wryly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"75\">They moved forward with purpose, past the wards, and Disapparated together with a loud crack.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"76\">Hogsmeade was how he remembered it from his fourth year, without Dementors and fear. People walked openly along the twisted and narrow streets, and Harry only felt a small twinge of resentment at these people who lived and laughed in a world without Voldemort. They had not paid the price the way Harry, Ron, and Ginny had. But they would change that, Harry thought fiercely. Ginny gripped his hand so hard that Harry felt his knuckles pop. When he looked at her, he saw her blazing look, for once not dimmed by sorrow.&nbsp;<em>They would do this.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"77\">The path to Hogwarts was as long as ever, but it seemed to take only minutes. No one had recognized them, thank Merlin; he supposed that people had stopped hoping to see them, they'd been hidden away for so long.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"78\">The gates loomed ahead of them, strong and stoic. Harry remembered when they were twisted and broken after the assault of Voldemort's giants.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"79\">\"<em>Harry?!\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"80\">The three whirled around and saw Hagrid, his mouth open wide with disbelief. He was just as tall as ever, and even wider than when Harry'd last seen him more than two years previously.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"81\">\"Ron? Ginny?\" Hagrid was too stunned to move.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"82\">\"Hi, Hagrid,\" Harry said. Ron and Ginny echoed him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"83\">\"Wha&hellip; What're yeh three doin' here?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"84\">\"We've come to see the Headmaster,\" Harry explained. \"Can you get us in the gates?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"85\">Hagrid pulled them open with one hand, and then rushed them, pulling all three into a bone-crushing hug. Harry patted him on the back. When he finally pulled away, he saw tears streaming into his wild beard.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"86\">\"I didn' think I'd ever see yer again!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"87\">Harry couldn't think of anything to say. Ron and Ginny were silent beside him. Hagrid did not seem to take offense at this, and chattered all the way up to the school. Grawp apparently had found a lady friend, and the centaurs had welcomed three new foals into the herd. Seamus Finnegan had apparently taken a post at the school, and was now the Professor for Defence Against the Dark Arts, despite his missing arm.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"88\">They rounded the greenhouses, and found themselves staring up at a sight they had never expected to see again. The grief welled up inside Harry as he stared at the repaired castle. The Astronomy Tower had been rebuilt, and Hogwarts looked as stately as ever. There were no blood-stains on the steps. It was as if it had never happened. But it had. Bill and Fleur had fallen just over there; Harry could still hear her screams as she stood over Bill's body, taking down three Death Eaters before Dolohov had killed her.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"89\">His mouth twisted grimly, and Ginny squeezed his hand.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"90\">The Entrance Hall was even worse. In his mind, Harry could still see Hermione burning and hear her anguished cries, could see George falling and breaking his entire body, could see Arthur Weasley hit in the back with&nbsp;<em>Avada Kedavra&nbsp;</em>while he'd been trying to avenge Bill's death. Charlie had been mangled by Fenrir Greyback just over there, near the stairs. And that was where an acromantula had torn Percy apart.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"91\">Ginny's eyes were wide with horror. She hadn't seen most of her family die; she'd been battling Death Eaters with Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil; but she'd seen the bodies where they lay. Harry had thought she was dead, had thought the Cutting Curse had killed Ron. And fifty feet and three years away from where he stood right now, he'd stood in front of Voldemort and had not defended himself, had watched death speed toward him in the form of a green light because he'd wanted to die. It had killed the Horcrux instead, and Harry had returned to finish off Voldemort, not knowing that Ron and Ginny had survived too.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"92\">He took a deep breath. Ron had his eyes squeezed tightly shut, his mouth moving, saying something Harry could not hear. Ginny shook like a leaf beside him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"93\">\"Yeh lot&hellip;\" Hagrid sighed. \"I know why yeh didn' wan' to come back.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"94\">Harry nodded stiffly. \"We still need to see Flitwick.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"95\">They left Hagrid and their memories behind and moved up the stairs with purpose. It was early yet, no students were out and about; they were still sleeping in their dormitories.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"96\">The gargoyle that guarded the home of the Headmaster was the same. Harry realized that he had no idea what the password was, and could not even begin to guess it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"97\">Ron kicked it with his foot. \"Open up!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"98\">\"No,\" the gargoyle said firmly. \"You don't know the password.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"99\">Harry was just about to send a message via Patronus when he heard footsteps quickly coming toward them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"100\">\"Merlin's balls!\" Seamus Finnegan skidded to a halt ten feet away from them. He threw out his arm and braced himself against the wall. \"I didn't think you three were even still alive!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"101\">\"Hi, Seamus,\" Ginny said quietly. Ron and Harry nodded at him in greeting. \"Do you know Flitwick's password? We've got to speak with him.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"102\">\"Uh,\" Seamus visibly tried to collect himself. It was odd seeing him with only one arm; at least it hadn't been his wand arm that had gotten severed off. \"It's caliadoc.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"103\">The gargoyle sprung aside and the moving stairs appeared behind it. \"What's caliadoc?\" Harry whispered. Ginny shrugged.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"104\">\"We'll see you, Seamus,\" Ron said. \"We'll catch up &ndash; later.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"105\">\"Er, yeah.\" They left him still standing there with his mouth gaping open. \"Yeah, see you around.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"106\">Harry knocked firmly three times. It took several moments for Flitwick to open the door, and they were greeted with the same expression of shock they'd seen on Hagrid's and Seamus's faces.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"107\">\"Well,\" Flitwick drew himself up to his full height, about three feet. \"<em>Well.</em>\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"108\">\"Headmaster,\" Harry said respectfully. \"We were wondering if we could converse with Dumbledore's portrait.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"109\">\"I&hellip; yes, of course,\" Flitwick led them in. It was similar to, yet very different from how it had been during Dumbledore's time. The small, delicate instruments (the ones that had survived Harry's wrath, anyway) were gone, and had been replaced by stacks of books. The portraits were the same. The occupant of the biggest one that hung right behind the large desk stared at Harry with widened eyes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"110\">\"Harry,\" the portrait of Albus Dumbledore said. \"And Mrs. Potter, and Mr. Weasley.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"111\">\"Dumbledore,\" the three murmured.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"112\">\"Should I&hellip;?\" Flitwick made vague motions toward the door. Harry felt a pang of guilt at forcing the diminutive man to leave his own office.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"113\">\"If you don't mind&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"114\">The door shut, and they were left alone.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"115\">Suddenly, Harry could not think of the words to say. He felt uncomfortable, and Dumbledore's piercing gaze and the mutterings of the other portraits did not make it any better.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"116\">Ginny nudged him, and Harry realized that he'd been staring for longer than he'd expected.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"117\">\"The price was too high,\" Harry said heavily. He felt tears sting his eyes. Dumbledore&nbsp;<em>had&nbsp;</em>to know if it was possible. He&nbsp;<em>had&nbsp;</em>to.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"118\">\"Oh, Harry&hellip;\" The portrait leaned back in his chair.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"119\">\"Is there any way&hellip; Do you know&hellip;\" Harry took a deep breath. \"We want to change it.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"120\">Dumbledore was silent for a long time.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"121\">\"We know a Time-Turner wouldn't work,\" Ron said gruffly. Ginny had started to shake again.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"122\">\"We want to go back to the battle,\" Harry said firmly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"123\">\"Why?\" Dumbledore asked. He'd folded his hands together and pierced each of them with his gaze.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"124\">Harry's mouth fell open. Wasn't it obvious? \"We want to&nbsp;<em>save&nbsp;</em>them, Dumbledore. We're not&hellip; we can't&hellip; We have to try! Is there &ndash;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"125\">But Dumbledore interrupted him. \"You misunderstand. Why go back to the battle? You could do very little. You might save one or two, but there would still be heavy losses.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"126\">Ginny stiffened.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"127\">\"Is there a way or not?\" Ron asked loudly. Harry felt like kicking him; they needed Dumbledore on their side!</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"128\">\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"129\">Harry turned away and ran his hands through his hair. Ginny gave a wordless cry, and clapped her hand over her mouth. Ron was breathing heavily, as if he had just run a few kilometers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"130\">\"There is a way,\" Dumbledore continued. \"There are several, actually, but only one that is advisable at this juncture. It isn't instant, of course; you will need to make several preparations, including a very complex potion, and complicated spell. You are lucky there are three of you. One man alone would find it nigh impossible.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"131\">\"We'll do it,\" Harry said instantly. \"Right now.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"132\">\"Ah, but there is no 'right now' when it comes to this,\" Dumbledore told them. \"You will need to prepare. The potion itself takes three years.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"133\">\"Three&nbsp;<em>years</em>?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"134\">\"Not to mention there are certain decisions you must make regarding it. How far back you need to travel, for instance. That must be decided before you even begin to make the potion, for the amount of ingredients you will need will vary slightly.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"135\">\"But&hellip; We want to go back three years,\" Harry said. \"To the battle.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"136\">\"I would not advise that,\" Dumbledore said. \"This is not at all like a Time-Turner; there will not be two of each of you running around. You will find yourself as pressed and challenged as you were that night. The only thing that will be different is that your memories of this timeline will remain. You will know when and where things you wish to stop happening will happen, but there is no guarantee that you will be able to.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"137\">\"Are&hellip; you think we shouldn't do this?\" Ginny asked tentatively. \"Because we've already made up our minds.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"138\">\"I very much think that you should do this, Mrs. Potter,\" Dumbledore's eyes twinkled like mad. \"But if you're doing this, you should do it&nbsp;<em>right</em>. In for a knut, in for a galleon, I'd say.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"139\">\"What the bloody hell does that mean?\" Ron asked rudely.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"140\">\"Hold on,\" Harry's mind worked frantically. \"I think&hellip; Do you mean that we should go back&nbsp;<em>further</em>?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"141\">\"Excellent, Harry,\" Dumbledore looked as pleased as though he'd gotten good marks on a difficult essay. \"If you go back far enough, you could&nbsp;<em>stop the final battle from happening at all.</em>\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"142\">Harry thought back. They could go back to any point in the years that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had been searching for Horcruxes. He knew exactly where they were, it would've made it so much faster and easier to hunt them down and destroy them. Voldemort would have less time to amass his army, and the odds against those who chose to stand with Harry would not be so bleak. He could even be sure to save Remus and Tonks and Teddy from being murdered in their own home. But&hellip; what if he could go back to before Dumbledore had died? He could stop him from putting on the ring; Snape would not have needed to kill him, and Harry could have the brilliant wizard at his side. Or he could go back even further&hellip;&nbsp;<em>Sirius</em>. The battle in the Department of Mysteries could have been avoided, Harry knew full well that it would be a trap, he wouldn't even go. And if he went back to his fourth year, he could ensure that Voldemort did not rise at the time, and Cedric could survive.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"143\">Ron and Ginny were watching him cautiously, and Harry realized that he was beaming.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"144\">\"I think we ought to go back to our first year,\" he told them. \"We can take care of the Horcruxes, we can stop a lot of bad things from happening, and we can have years and years of preparing before Voldemort is resurrected. Dumbledore,\" he turned to the portrait. \"Do you think I'll still have a Horcrux inside me if I go back?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"145\">\"Absolutely,\" he said. \"The only things that will change are your memories. The prophecy will still exist, although I'd be curious to see if it changes at all. It is possible&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"146\">Harry looked alarmed, but Dumbledore rushed to reassure him. \"It will not change the essence of the prophecy, I don't think. But I would not be surprised if the wording changed.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"147\">\"What is this method, Dumbledore?\" Ginny asked.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"148\">\"The potion is called the Tears of Merlin &ndash; he was the one who created it and, I believe, the only one to use it. The spell is called the Web, or the Bent Reality. It takes both to do it, they're very clearly entwined with each other,\" Dumbledore paused. \"I would suggest that you plan extremely carefully what you intend to do. Write it all down. Go through it step by step before you even begin. You'll be allowed some room, but your goals must be clear.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"149\">\"Er, why?\" Ron asked.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"150\">\"The key ingredients of the potion are your memories,\" Dumbledore said quietly. \"You'll need to add as much of them as you can, everything you can offer. I would recommend speaking to others about their memories of the war, and add those in as well. All the knowledge you have will give you greater ammunition for your eleven-year-old selves.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"151\">\"So the potion involves our memories?\" Harry asked. \"Is it like a Pensieve?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"152\">\"Yes,\" Dumbledore beamed at him. \"Exactly. But once those memories are in the potion, you can't access them, which is why you need to plan very, very carefully. I will, of course, be of all the help I can. The last memory you will offer will be making the potion. The only thing you won't be able to take with you is the incantation for the spell.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"153\">\"And where can we find information on this?\" Ron asked, and then added hopefully, \"Do you have it memorized?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"154\">\"No, but you'll find it in the Restricted Section in a slim book called&nbsp;<em>Memories Unbound</em>. It has an entire chapter.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"155\">\"Well,\" Harry said finally. \"It looks like we've got quite a lot of work to do.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"156\">\"If anyone can do it properly, it'll be you three,\" Dumbledore said. \"I only have one thing to ask of you. Please tell me. I know,\" he paused. \"I know it made you angry that I kept things from you, Harry. And I do apologize &ndash;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"157\">\"Of course we're going to tell you,\" Harry grinned at him. \"I'm not about to alienate one of my best allies.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"158\">\"We'd better get to work,\" Ron said. \"Three years starts now.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"159\">HPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHP</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"160\">In the end, it took them four years of careful, plodding preparations. Despite their impatience, they knew they had to get this right. They had a lot to lose.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"161\">The black-haired man sat beside a red-haired woman whom he barely remembered, but for whom he felt an aching tenderness though he did not know why. Theoretically he knew that he and the woman and the red-haired man were working on something desperate. Something that kept them going even though they had no idea what. Sometimes they joked about it. He had the feeling that they used to joke a lot more.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"162\">Yesterday, the strange potion had crystallized. Three shards of what looked like translucent, glowing glass remained in the cauldron. The black-haired man wanted to touch it, even though he knew that that was the last thing he should do. It would ruin everything. But what, he asked himself, was everything? He knew that he would find the answers in the cauldron, but every time he thought of touching it, his heart constricted in his chest. The red-haired man asked him every day if he knew why they couldn't touch it, but the black-haired man couldn't remember.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"163\">\"We have to say the spell,\" the beautiful red-haired woman said. \"It's ready.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"164\">\"How do you know?\" The black-haired man asked fearfully. \"What if it isn't?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"165\">\"It says here in our notes,\" she replied. \"I wrote this: 'when the potion crystallizes, it is time to use the spell. DO NOT TOUCH IT.'\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"166\">\"All right,\" the red-haired man said. \"We'll say the spell. I remember the spell, at least. Just not anything else.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"167\">\"Isn't that what was supposed to happen?\" the black-haired man asked. It frustrated him that he could not remember this man's name. He felt that he ought to know it, but his entire head felt like a gaping hole.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"168\">\"Yes, we've written it all over here,\" the red-haired man said. \"I wonder why we kept writing notes to ourselves.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"169\">\"I don't know if we'll ever know.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"170\">\"We should say it,\" The black-haired man said firmly. \"Right now, before we forget anything else.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"171\">They clasped hands. The red-haired woman began a long incantation that sounded like a song. The two men joined in. They kept it up, even as the lights went out and the room darkened. The only light came from the cauldron.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"172\">The black-haired man watches as the shards of glass rose in the air and stuck to something that looked like a spider web made of tiny lights. It hurt his eyes, so he blinked. The room steadily darkened, and the woman's palm was sweating. The other man was shaking.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"173\">He heard a cry that lifted the hairs off his neck. He'd never heard anything like it. It seemed to last for a life-time, and then everything went completely dark. A strange thought echoed through his mind:&nbsp;<em>for always and always.&nbsp;</em>Still gripping the others' hands, he tumbled forward into nothing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Dudley's second bedroom looked remarkably the same, and Harry felt a strange sense of vertigo. He dug the heels of his hands against his eyes, and sat up straight. The moment of disorientation passed and he laughed out loud. They had done it! He, Ron, and Ginny had actually sent their memories back in time.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"1\">He looked down at his small hands with wonder. He stood up, tore off his clothes, and stood naked in front of a mirror. He was eleven years old again! He laughed until tears streamed down his face.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"2\">Aunt Petunia chose that moment to bang on his door. \"Get ready! You'd better not make us late. You're lucky we're even taking you to that&hellip; that place.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"3\">He was eleven years old and heading off to Hogwarts for the very first time the second time around.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"4\">Everything was the same. The same breakfast, the same headlines on the newspaper Uncle Vernon read at the kitchen table, the same vacant expression in Dudley's eyes and the scream he gave when he saw Harry staring at him. The car ride was the same, and Uncle Vernon shouted the exact same words he had before.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"5\">And in what felt like no time at all, Harry was standing alone in front of the barrier to platform 9 &frac34;. He waited around, hoping to catch sight of the Weasleys. He felt some anxiety. The efforts may have placed him exactly where he wanted to be, but his wife and best mate might have had trouble.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"6\">\"&mdash;packed with Muggles, of course,\" He heard Mrs. Weasley say, and spun around. There coming toward him was his favorite family in the world; they looked just as frazzled, but it was such a beautiful sight that Harry had to turn away to compose himself. He schooled his features, trying to look a little lost, and hoped that his anxiety would not be misinterpreted.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"7\">Percy strode forward rather pompously and disappeared beyond the barrier. The twins, after giving their mother trouble, did likewise. Harry watched them go, and hoped he didn't look like a maniac. He couldn't seem to stop himself from grinning wide enough that his cheeks felt like they were about to split.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"8\">\"Excuse me,\" He said a bit shakily. \"Do you know how to get through the barrier?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"9\">\"First time?\" Mrs. Weasley asked kindly. \"It's Ron's first time too.\" She gestured to her son, as if Harry did not know this boy almost as well as he knew himself.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"10\">Ron grinned, and when his mother looked away, winked at Harry. Harry grinned back.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"11\">\"Best to do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous,\" Mrs. Weasley was saying. \"Go on, you go first.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"12\">He passed through the barrier and immediately set off to find the empty compartment at the end of the train. His head swiveled back and forth; he drank in the sight of so many people he'd known and lost. Lee Jordan was there with his tarantula. Angelina Johnson screamed when he thrust it toward her while Katie Bell and a fifth year whose name escaped Harry looked on and laughed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"13\">\"I've lost my toad again, Gran,\" he heard Neville say to his formidable looking grandmother.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"14\">\"Oh, Neville,\" she sighed. Harry covered his mouth to hide his grin.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"15\">He still struggled with his trunk, and was just about to levitate it when George came up.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"16\">\"Need help with that?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"17\">\"Please,\" Harry said.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"18\">\"Oi, Fred! C'mere and help,\" George called. Together, the three of them lifted it up. When Harry paused to wipe his forehead, Fred gasped.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"19\">\"What's that?\" He pointed at Harry's forehead where the lightning scar was highly visible.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"20\">\"Blimey!\" George noticed the same thing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"21\">\"It is!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"22\">They stared at Harry, their mouths gaping.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"23\">\"You're Harry Potter!\" They said in unison.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"24\">\"Er, yeah, that's me,\" Harry replied.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"25\">They kept staring at him, but left when Mrs. Weasley called them. Harry, feeling a bit overwhelmed, threw himself down on the seat, making sure he had a good view of the Weasley family. He stared at Ginny, and she must have felt his gaze, because she lifted her eyes to him. Even from here he could see that she was crying. He wanted to jump off the train and hold her, but forced himself not to by taking deep breaths. He remembered very clearly what they had decided. They could not do anything at all suspicious, not until the time was right to tell them all.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"26\">\"Ron's been acting odd all day,\" he heard Percy tell his mother loftily. \"I think he's nervous about Hogwarts. But don't worry, Mum, I'll take care of him. It's my duty as a prefect.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"27\">\"Oh, are you a prefect, Perce?\" Fred asked with an air of great surprise.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"28\">Harry laughed as they mocked their brother, and ducked his head when they mentioned meeting him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"29\">\"Are you sure it was him, Fred?\" Mrs. Weasley asked. \"How could you tell?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"30\">\"His scar,\" George said. \"It's really there &ndash; like lightning.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"31\">Ron found Harry a few minutes later just as the train was pulling away from the station. \"Anyone sitting here?\" He asked slyly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"32\">Harry laughed. \"Nope, just me.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"33\">His eyes fell on Wormtail, and he was glad to see that Ron had not made good on his threat to murder him as soon as possible. While it would've made Harry quite pleased to think that the man who had betrayed his parents to Voldemort and had, in the other time, murdered Daphne Greengrass and Dean Thomas, Wormtail had to live until Sirius could be freed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"34\">He and Ron chatted idly for a time. Harry could not help but be impressed by Ron's ability to dissemble.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"35\">\"You've got a big family,\" Harry observed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"36\">\"Yeah, they all went to Hogwarts, too,\" Ron replied. \"My little sister is going to turn eleven, so next year she'll be at Hogwarts too. She cried all morning about it, actually. Says she wishes she could be with us too. But if I didn't know any better, I'd say she's a bit glad to have Mum and Dad around for one more year.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"37\">Harry gave him a grateful look. So Ginny had been crying, but Harry'd bet a hundred galleons that she was crying for completely different reasons.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"38\">\"This is Scabbers,\" Ron held up the snoozing rat. \"He's not much; he used to be my brother Percy's rat. Ginny almost killed him today, isn't that right, Scabbers? He was sleeping &ndash; he always sleeps &ndash; and she accidentally stepped on him,\" his face darkened. \"At least I&nbsp;<em>think&nbsp;</em>it was an accident. She might've thought that I'd stay home if my pet was hurt.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"39\">Harry had to hide his laugh. He hoped she'd hurt him bad. \"Poor Scabbers,\" he said solemnly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"40\">The lunch trolley came and went. Harry once again bought plenty of snacks, although this time Ron threw his sandwiches out the window and ate chocolate frogs like there was no tomorrow.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"41\">Both he and Ron chatted idly, careful &ndash; very careful &ndash; not to say anything at all odd. While Scabbers had only been a rat until their third year, they could not afford to let Peter Pettigrew, betrayer of friends and murderer of Muggles, hear anything suspicious. They knew very well that they walked a very narrow path.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"42\">They were also well aware that they'd be visited by old friends who had no idea who they were, so it did not come as a surprise (although Harry's stomach gave a jolt) when Neville Longbottom, last seen dead on the flagstones of Hogwarts, opened the door and poked his head in, so shy that he did not meet their eyes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"43\">\"Have either of you seen a toad? I've lost mine.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"44\">It was lucky that his eyes were averted, for Harry had a huge lump in his throat, and he could tell by the look in Ron's eyes that he was thinking the same.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"45\">\"No,\" Harry said softly. \"Sorry.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"46\">\"Thanks, then,\" Neville disappeared.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"47\">Ron took several deep breaths, and glanced at Wormtail swiftly. \"He scared me, popping out like that. I didn't even hear the door open.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"48\">\"Me either,\" Harry winked. \"I wonder what our classmates are like. He seems a nice enough sort.\" That didn't nearly cover it. Neville had been a champion and fearless when it came to defending his friends. This time around his life would not end in murder; he would not leave Hannah a widow less than a year after their marriage. He'd work with plants, have a bunch of round-faced babies, and live to be a doddering old man, and Harry would never, ever have to watch him die.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"49\">Harry shut his eyes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"50\">He and Ron sat in silence for a long while; Harry suspected that his best mate had fallen into the same morass of disturbing memories that he had. Ron drew his wand after perhaps an hour and made vague flicking motions, while glancing hopefully at the door again and again. Harry knew what he was waiting for: Hermione.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"51\">She did not disappoint them. A short, bushy-haired, buck-toothed girl huffed in with Neville on her heels. \"Have either of you seen a toad?\" She asked bossily. \"Neville's lost one.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"52\">For a moment, just a moment, Harry saw her on fire. He firmly pushed those memories away. \"Er, sorry. We still haven't seen him.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"53\">\"Oh, are you doing a spell?\" She asked eagerly. She plunked down on the seat opposite Ron, next to Harry, and focused all her attention on the wand in Ron's hand.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"54\">\"Uh, it's not a very good spell,\" Ron said. His hand was trembling a little. \"My brothers, Fred and George taught me it.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"55\">Harry watched in amusement as Ron stuttered through that useless little rhyme the twins had taught him long ago just to torment him. Struck with inspiration, he eased his own wand out of his pocket and sent a wordless Stinging Hex at the treacherous rat.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"56\">The effect was immediate. Wormtail sprang up, hair raised, and ran squeaking around and around the compartment. Hermione, who had looked skeptical as soon as she heard the beginning of the rhyme, looked on with her mouth agape.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"57\">\"That wasn't supposed to happen,\" Ron muttered. \"He was supposed to turn yellow.\" It took several minutes and all three of them to catch the rat. \"Sorry, Scabbers,\" he said. If Harry didn't know him as well as he did, he would have had no reason to doubt his sincerity. Hermione didn't even look at all suspicious.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"58\">\"Well, that wasn't a very good spell, was it?\" She asked haughtily. \"I think you hurt the poor little thing.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"59\">\"Nah,\" Ron said. \"Look &ndash; he already went back to sleep!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"60\">\"I'm Hermione Granger,\" she announced. \"And you are?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"61\">\"Ron Weasley.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"62\">\"Harry Potter.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"63\">\"Are you really?!\" She sat up straight and stared at him, her eyes wide. \"I've read all about you. You're in the&nbsp;<em>Greatest Wizarding Events in the 20</em><em>th</em><em>&nbsp;Century</em>, and all sorts of other books. The Chosen One who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"64\">What the&nbsp;<em>hell</em>? Harry nearly fell off his chair, and exchanged startled glances with Ron.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"65\">\"Oh, honestly, don't you know?\" Hermione asked, tilting her nose in the air. \"If I were you, I'd have read everything I could about it. Everyone knows that you were the prophesied defeater of You-Know-Who.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"66\">\"Oh, ha ha,\" Ron, obviously thinking very quickly, gave a shaky little laugh. \"Of course he knows. Everyone knows.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"67\">\"Yeah,\" Harry nodded, trying to look as though this was not completely new to him. \"I was just surprised, that's all.\" Damn right. Since when was the prophecy common knowledge? His insides twisted with anxiety.&nbsp;<em>What else had changed?</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"68\">Hermione sniffed. \"Good.\" She looked Harry up and down appraisingly. \"I don't suppose you know the entire prophecy?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"69\">Did he? \"Er&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"70\">\"That's all right,\" she said, but looked disappointed. \"You probably wouldn't tell me if you did. It's such a big secret.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"71\">Hermione chattered on for a while. Harry attempted to pay attention to her, but his thoughts were whirling and whirling inside his head. It was imperative that he speak to Dumbledore. Tonight, if possible.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"72\">From that point on the entire trip became much less pleasant, and not only because Malfoy had made his appearance, attempted to cozen up to Harry, and had taken exception to being rebuffed. Draco Malfoy had turned out to be not quite the arse Harry had expected, but that didn't mean that Harry liked him any better. He was still a foul bigot, just not a foul, bigoted murderer.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"73\">Ron and Harry were much more subdued when they got off the train and got in the boats. Seeing Hagrid had alleviated some of the tension, and seeing the excitement on so many of the faces of Harry's classmates &ndash; including several who had died in ways that plagued Harry with guilt &ndash; did more. But it was with a heavy heart that he sailed across the lake, and trudged up the stairs; it was not until Professor McGonagall, sane and upright, opened the door for them that Harry once again felt the fierce resolve that had driven him for the last four years.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"74\">Harry walked beside Ron into the Great Hall, and did not have to feign wonder. So many people here that he had thought lost! Dumbledore chatting, Snape scowling, and countless others alive and merry. It was almost too much.&nbsp;<em>Always and always,&nbsp;</em>he thought.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"75\">He desperately needed to talk to Ron. They had a lot to discuss (the prophecy, and how to let Ginny know about the change), and to plan (the finer details of the prank they were to pull on the Potions Master). He only hoped that they could detach themselves from the horde of first years long enough to make a break for the Room of Requirment. Harry felt almost naked without the Invisibility Cloak.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"76\">\"Potter!\" Professor McGonagall stared at him, her mouth a thin line. \"I suggest you allow yourself to be Sorted!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"77\">Ron snorted and pushed Harry forward.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"78\">He put on the Sorting Hat, feeling a bit nervous about the Hat's reaction. He had no idea how it would react, and Dumbledore's portrait had been almost as clueless. Voldemort had destroyed it after he'd used it to suffocate Neville Longbottom.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"79\"><em>Ahhhhhh</em>. It seemed to Harry that the Hat had sighed. He could almost feel it in his brain.&nbsp;<em>This is something&hellip; something beyond rare.&nbsp;</em>The Hat seemed not to be particularly eloquent when faced with something that surprised it. Harry felt the mad urge to laugh.&nbsp;<em>More rare than surviving a Killing Curse at the age of one?&nbsp;</em>He thought, knowing the Hat would hear.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"80\">The Hat was silent for a long time, longer than the first time, and Harry began to shift uncomfortably in his seat.&nbsp;<em>Don't you dare put me in Slytherin,&nbsp;</em>he warned it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"81\"><em>I ought to. I really ought to. I can see all the cunning in you, although of a different sort than I usually see. The ambition, the drive, is there as well, even if it is to prevent what happened&hellip; before. Not to mention the thirst to prove yourself.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"82\"><em>Please.&nbsp;</em>Harry felt as though he'd reached a new low, begging a Hat.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"83\"><em>I think you're right.&nbsp;</em>The Hat finally murmured.&nbsp;<em>It all comes down courage, doesn't it? I don't think I've seen the like in many a year.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"84\">\"GRYFFINDOR!\" The Hat shouted.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"85\">Harry was far too relieved to notice that there were far more speculative glances than applauding hands this time around.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"86\">HPHPHPHPHPHPHPHP</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"87\">\"Blimey, Harry, that was close!\" Ron threw himself down on a plush armchair that the Room of Requirement had manifested. They'd taken a brief detour to retrieve the wretched tiara Horcrux from the Room of Hidden Things. It had taken longer than expected, but Harry held it in his hand. \"You were up there for almost fifteen minutes!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"88\">\"You were up there for almost ten,\" Harry said sourly. \"At least we're in Gryffindor, mate.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"89\">\"That was way too close,\" Ron agreed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"90\">\"Speaking of close, we can't stay long.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"91\">\"Percy would hang us,\" Ron smiled fondly. \"You know, I'd almost forgotten how pompous he was.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"92\">\"Is,\" Harry said quietly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"93\">\"I can't believe we actually did it, Harry,\" Ron said seriously. \"I wasn't sure&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"94\">\"We're here,\" They grinned at each other madly, and Harry once again felt on the verge of tears. But he forced himself to not get too complacent. Having everyone back was amazing, but they had to move forward with purpose. \"But what exactly have we done?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"95\">\"I have no idea,\" Ron shook his head. \"It seems like a small sort of change, honestly. And Hermione said that no one knew all of it, so the you-being-a-Horcrux thing is probably safe.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"96\">Harry shuddered. \"Can you imagine what Voldemort would've done if he'd known?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"97\">\"No,\" Ron said. \"And I don't want to think about that. But&hellip; it makes me wonder what else has changed. Makes me wish we'd come back a few days earlier, maybe we could've figured some of this stuff out.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"98\">\"Without being here and worrying about Quirrell,\" Harry agreed. He made a face. \"I'm glad I didn't have to be around the Dursleys that much. It was kind of cool to realize that, yes, they really are total arses. But any more of them and I'd feel sick. I've got to put up with it over the summers.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"99\">\"Yeah,\" Ron looked thoughtful, and Harry had to laugh. \"What?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"100\">\"Just that I never saw that expression on your face until at&nbsp;<em>least</em>&nbsp;second year last time.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"101\">Ron threw a pillow at him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"102\">\"We're going to have to wait until we speak to Dumbledore,\" Harry turned the conversation back to more serious matters. \"You can write a letter to Ginny tonight, though, and give her a heads-up.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"103\">\"Yeah, that's what I reckon too,\" Ron replied. He looked down at his watch. \"We've got to go. They'll be suspicious if we don't turn up soon. Not to mention we've got to nick those Dungbombs from the twins.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"104\">They rose to go, but Harry halted. \"Is it bad to be looking forward to all the trouble we're going to cause tomorrow?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"105\">Ron snorted. \"No. Is it bad to be having impure thoughts about an eleven year old girl?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"106\">Harry laughed. \"It's better than thinking the same about a ten year old.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"107\">\"We've become very perverted, Harry.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"108\">HPHPHPHPHPHPHP</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"109\"><em>Dear Ginny,</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"110\"><em>I'll bet you're surprised I'm writing you already! The Express was amazing. We saw loads of cool people. By 'we', I mean Harry Potter. Yes, The Harry Potter, the one you want to marry. He's a cool bloke, and he asked me if that red-haired little girl (you, in case you're too thick to realize it) was my sister. I think he fancied you. Anyway, this girl Hermione Granger came in and started talking all about that prophecy. She asked him if he knew what it was, and I don't think he did.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"111\"><em>We tried our very first bit of magic, too. We meant to turn Scabbers yellow with that spell Fred and George taught us, but instead it hurt him, and he ran squeaking all around the compartment. I thought it was funny, but I didn't want to hurt the rat's feelings, so I didn't laugh.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"112\"><em>Harry and I are in Gryffindor! I was hoping that would happen, but it took the Sorting Hat &ndash; yes, it's a harmless hat, we didn't have to battle a troll at all &ndash; about twice as long to Sort us as it did everyone else.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"113\"><em>Anyway, I've got to go wash. I smell like Fred and George!</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"114\"><em>Ron</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"115\"><em>P.S. Say hi to Auntie Muriel for me (and try to steal her tiara!)</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"116\">HPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHP</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"117\">Time marched swiftly the next day. Transfiguration and Charms went well, Harry had to say. He'd been quite nervous about being in a first-year class, pretending not to know spells that he'd mastered sixteen years previously. There was a fine balance between looking suspiciously genius and suspiciously stupid, but Harry thought he'd done all right.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"118\">Ron, walking beside him on their way to Potions, looked disgruntled. He'd been a bit more lax than Harry, and had tried to impress Hermione. Harry had wanted to laugh at the look on his face when she'd&nbsp;<em>still&nbsp;</em>managed to turn her match into a needle before he had.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"119\">\"Cheer up, mate,\" He said in a low voice. \"She'll always keep you on your toes.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"120\">\"At least we get to torture Snape now,\" Ron muttered.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"121\">They filed in with the rest of their classmates, and Ron managed to find a seat next to Hermione without making it look intentional. Snape, black cloak billowing behind him, made quite the entrance, and glared at those who were too thick to realize that he was not a teacher to annoy with unapproved chatter.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"122\">What happened next startled Harry.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"123\">It was word for word identical as the last time. Snape attempted to humiliate him, of course, by pointing out his celebrity status. The thoughtful crease in the Professor's brow, however, Harry was pretty sure was different. He then was practically interrogated by the man, and asked questions that he knew for sure that no other first year student (besides Hermione, of course) would know.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"124\">His own reaction to it was different. Not on the outside, Harry made sure to fidget and say 'I don't know' a lot. But his emotional reaction was quite different. The first time around, he'd felt badgered, confused, and furious. This time, he felt an odd sort of kinship with the man. Snape had lost the one person he'd cared about: Harry's mother. The fact that he'd lost her years before she'd died was immaterial. The loss had devastated him, had turned him bitter, and he'd been broken. But when all was said and done, and Harry had viewed his memories (too late, far too late), he had realized that Snape was quite possibly the bravest man he'd ever met.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"125\">He was so lost in thought that he nearly forgot to give Ron the cue. He elbowed him sharply.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"126\">Ron stood up immediately and shouted, \"What the bloody hell is wrong with you, you greasy git?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"127\">\"Yeah!\" Harry stood up too. That probably would've done it, but they had to be sure that Snape would be furious enough to want to them expelled, and have enough ammunition to actually make a case of it. \"Slimeball!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"128\">That's why they each reached into the pockets of their robes, pulled out a handful of Dungbombs, and threw them on the floor at Snape's feet.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"129\">The reaction was immediate. The other students lurched to their feet, covering their mouths and noses, and ran for the door. Hermione, retching and glaring at them, followed suit.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"130\">Snape did not move. He stood in front of them, staring at them, and his face grew angrier and angrier by the second. The room seemed to grow colder.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"131\">\"I would take points from Gryffindor,\" he spoke without moving his lips. \"But you&nbsp;<em>will&nbsp;</em>be expelled for this. Come with me, the Headmaster has that happy authority.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"132\">Harry and Ron marched in front of him, and glad of it because neither one could help smirking. Snape had fallen right into their hands. No matter how brave he was, and how much Harry had regretted not trusting him, it still felt pretty good.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"133\">\"Ugh! What's that&nbsp;<em>smell</em>?\" The students rushed to get out of the way and stared after them. Harry could hear Snape growling threats under his breath.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"134\">It seemed to take no time at all to get to the familiar gargoyle.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"135\">\"Lemon Drops,\" Snape hissed. It jumped aside. \"Up. Now.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"136\">Snape pushed them roughly out of the way and pounded on the heavy door. \"DUMBLEDORE!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"137\">\"Enter,\" Dumbledore's voice. \"What is it, Severus? Is it Qui&mdash;<em>Ah.</em>\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"138\">Harry stared at the floor, marshalling his thoughts and fighting back tears. He hadn't seen Dumbledore alive for an entire decade, and he was their absolute best chance. He, Ron, and Ginny had become pretty powerful, but Dumbledore was formidable, both with his wand and with his mind. He could tell them where the holes in their plans were. He could make it air-tight. Harry hadn't known how much of a relief it would be.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"139\">He peeked, and saw Dumbledore's face as he heard a slightly exaggerated (although it wasn't really necessary, what he and Ron had done was damning enough) version of events from Snape. He did not look angry, but he did have a look on his face that Harry couldn't read.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"140\">\"The Weasley boy called me a greasy git, and Potter called me a slimeball, right before they threw the Dungbombs,\" Snape said with relish.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"141\">After a long, long moment, Dumbledore said very quietly, \"Look at me.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"142\">Ron, who'd been shaking with silent laughter for the last several minutes, stopped and looked up. Despite the fact that they pretty much knew that they weren't going to be in serious trouble (well, they knew that they wouldn't be expelled), Harry could see apprehension on his friend's face.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"143\">\"You've done serious damage today,\" Dumbledore said to the both of them. Several portraits on the walls agreed. \"Bring back corporal punishment, and send them back home with bloody backs,\" Phineas Nigellus suggested laconically. Snape appeared to agree whole-heartedly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"144\">\"Enough, Phineas,\" Dumbledore held up a hand to silence the portrait of Sirius' ancestor, and Hogwarts' least popular headmaster. \"The two of you have shown blatant disregard for authority, caused the Potions classroom to be evacuated, disrupted class, and did it with Dungbombs, a substance banned at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please explain to me why you did this.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"145\">\"You're letting them explain?\" Snape asked, horrified. \"Just expel them and be done with it!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"146\">\"Severus. I see no possible explanation that would save them from being expelled,\" Dumbledore seemed a little sad as he peered at Harry.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"147\">\"I do,\" Ron said loudly. Snape looked ready to murder him, but then he pinned a glare on Harry so malevolent that Harry actually took a step backward.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"148\">\"You knew it could go both ways, Dumbledore,\" Snape sneered. \"This only proves it. We've got another Dark Lord, not a bloody savior!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"149\">Harry and Ron exchanged uncertain glances, and Harry had a sneaking suspicion that the prophecy was very, very different here.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"150\">After that moment of confusion, Ron laughed out loud.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"151\">\"And not to forget the loyal follower,\" Snape said. Dumbledore said nothing, but appeared to be deep in thought. \"It explains much. The reason why he's&nbsp;<em>marked as an equal</em>!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"152\">This time, Harry laughed. It burst out of him, he couldn't stop it. He felt bitterness and incredulity, and that's where part of the laughter came from, the part that also wanted to cry. The majority of it, however, was simply because it was&nbsp;<em>funny</em>. Ron laughed with him, and Harry feared that they both sounded quite, quite mad. He couldn't wait to hear Ginny's reaction.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"153\">With an effort, Harry stopped. He wiped his eyes, adjusted his robes and, feeling more confident, met Dumbledore's eyes. The brilliant blue eyes did not have even a trace of the familiar twinkle (in fact, Dumbledore looked concerned, perplexed, and quite angry), but Harry felt comforted nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"154\">\"We did it so we could come up here and talk to you without suspicion,\" Harry said.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"155\">\"Yeah, sorry about the things we said. And about the Dungbombs,\" Ron chuckled. \"I don't really think you're a greasy git.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"156\">\"And I don't think you're a slimeball,\" Harry added.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"157\">\"They're lying!\" Snape shouted, outraged. \"Dumbledore, don't listen to them!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"158\">\"Well, yeah, you're a bit of a greasy git,\" Harry heard the fondness in Ron's voice, but he didn't think the other two did because they found themselves thrown into rapidly conjured chairs and tied there with ropes made of what looked like liquid magic. Harry settled himself more comfortably.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"159\">\"You are trying my patience,\" Dumbledore said coldly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"160\">\"Nice wand,\" Harry said pointedly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"161\">\"They're both mad,\" Snape said, sounding triumphant. \"That's what the 'bent' line meant. Potter's unhinged, and he took Weasley with him.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"162\">\"Hold a moment, Severus. Why on earth did you want to see me without anyone knowing?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"163\">\"We're not mad, Professor,\" Harry said. He'd started to tremble a little.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"164\">\"Yeah, but you've got to promise to listen to us,\" Ron added.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"165\">\"I do not believe you gentlemen are in any position to make demands. Speak quickly.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"166\">\"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?\" Ron asked Harry.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"167\">\"Yes,\" Harry said. They both turned to stare at the wand Dumbledore held. He was not pointing it at them, but they both knew that Dumbledore was very,&nbsp;<em>very&nbsp;</em>fast.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"168\">\"He just might use the Elder Wand on us,\" Ron said.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"169\">\"Oh, honestly,\" Snape said scathingly. He turned to Dumbledore. Harry had to admire the shuttered expression on the older man's face that masked the surprise he must be feeling. Absurd pride bubbled up inside him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"170\">\"Explain,\" He said again, but in a different tone. It was a mixture of danger and confusion.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"171\">\"We're from the future,\" Ron said cheerfully.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"172\">Snape pulled out his wand, rushed over to stand in front of Ron, and pointed it straight at his head.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"173\">\"Stand down, Severus,\" Dumbledore said. He had risen from his chair. \"I'm almost certain the boys are mad. But they knew that I have the Elder Wand and I&nbsp;<em>will&nbsp;</em>know why.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"174\">Snape's wand clattered to the floor. \"You have the&nbsp;<em>Elder Wand</em>? Isn't that a fairy tale?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"175\">\"No,\" Dumbledore said. \"The Deathly Hallows are very real.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"176\">\"Yeah, and you have another one, don't you?\" Ron smirked. \"Where's Harry's Cloak?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"177\">Dumbledore sat down heavily. \"Why?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"178\">\"You're still asking for explanations when these two should have been expelled ten minutes ago and sent on their merry way,\" Snape said, but he still looked unsettled.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"179\">\"I think if he asked 'how' he'd get a truthful answer and a reason for the 'bent' line as well,\" Harry said quietly. They'd had their fun, and now it was time for the truth.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"180\">Dumbledore's brow furrowed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"181\">\"We used the Tears of Merlin,\" Harry continued. The wizard lifted his head up sharply.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"182\">\"Impossible, the Tears of Merlin is just a fairy tale,\" Snape said.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"183\">\"Yeah, just like the Deathly Hallows,\" Ron told him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"184\">\"It is possible, Severus,\" Dumbledore's expression was absolutely unreadable. \"But I am not yet sure if I believe them. Prove it.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"185\">Harry closed his eyes, wishing that he did not have to do this, but the portrait of the man sitting in front of him had told him that this was what he must do, if Dumbledore required incontrovertible proof. And with all the gentleness he was capable of, he said, \"You see Ariana in the Mirror of Erised. And the family you lost. Your father, dead in Azkaban, because he avenged what the three Muggle boys did to your sister. Your mother who died accidentally because of your sister. Your sister, dead because she got in the middle of a duel between three boys. Your brother, who has never, ever trusted you since then. They all stand there before you, smiling, and you know that they've forgiven you for your mistakes. And there's someone else there. You also see,\" he licked his lips. \"You also see a man who never existed. A kind Gellert Grindelwald &ndash;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"186\">\"ENOUGH!\" Snape shouted. \"What is this vile madness you're sprouting, Potter?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"187\">Harry could not bear to see the pain on Dumbledore's face. He looked away.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"188\"><em>\"Why?\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"189\">It had worked, Harry thought. Or Dumbledore thought he meant to torment him, and was asking why he would do such a thing. But Harry placed his bet on the latter, and so gave the same answer he had given the portrait four years ago.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"190\">\"The price was too high,\" Harry told him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"191\">\"You won?\" Dumbledore asked sharply.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"192\">\"No,\" Ron said firmly. \"Harry defeated Voldemort. But we lost everyone else except for my sister. She's here too. Well, not here. I expect she's at the Burrow.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"193\">\"Dumbledore?\" Snape asked.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"194\">\"Severus, what Harry said could only have come from my own mouth. I have to believe him.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"195\">\"I'm sorry,\" Harry said. \"Your portrait &ndash;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"196\">\"My portrait?\" Dumbledore interrupted. \"I did not survive?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"197\">\"No, Snape killed you,\" Ron sad bluntly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"198\">\"I would&nbsp;<em>never &ndash;\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"199\">\"You would if you knew that Dumbledore was dying, surrounded by Death Eaters, and by his own command. Fenrir Greyback was there, as well as Bellatrix Lestrange,\" Harry replied. He looked away, remembering that death, and how it had shaped the years of the Horcrux hunt, and how things might have been different if he had only known. This time it would be different. He turned back to Dumbledore, who suddenly looked very, very old. \"Please tell me the prophecy. I already know there are differences.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"200\">\"What was your prophecy?\" Dumbledore asked.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"201\">Harry told him, and his voice only shook a little when he stated the part that meant he was a Horcrux. He knew this time, though. It wouldn't be too late.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"202\">\"It is&hellip; very similar,\" Dumbledore said. \"The one in the here and now is this:&nbsp;<em>The Chosen One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches&hellip; born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies&hellip; and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have terrible power the Dark Lord knows not&hellip; he has been bent for always and always&hellip; and either must die at the hand of the other, for neither can live while the other survives.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"203\">Harry started to cry. Not sobs, not like the kind he'd experienced in the months after the final battle, not great gasping things that shook his entire body and made him feel worse. But tears slid down his face rapidly, and he knew without having to look that Ron did the same thing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"204\"><em>For always and always.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"205\">Snape was surprisingly tactful, although Harry thought he might be too stunned to speak. He and Dumbledore said nothing until the two men who had been Bent for always and always had composed themselves.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"206\">\"Sorry,\" Harry said shakily. \"That was unexpected. Very unexpected.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"207\">\"Which part?\" Dumbledore inquired.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"208\">\"His prophecy sounds an awful lot like ours, but with the bits about his questionable loyalties taken out,\" Snape said, but it didn't sound like he really meant it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"209\">\"Bent doesn't mean mad,\" Ron said. \"That's the name of the spell that went with the potion. The Bent Reality spell, although I suppose it's more of a charm.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"210\">\"What does it mean?\" Dumbledore asked. \"'Bent for always and always.' Do you know?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"211\">\"Yes,\" Harry breathed. \"We were Bent for always and always.\" It felt very personal, speaking of this.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"212\">\"And what, precisely, is 'always and always'?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"213\">\"It's you,\" Harry said simply. \"And you, I suppose. And Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Bill and Fleur Weasley. Charlie Weasley. Percy Weasley. Fred and George Weasley. Hermione Granger. Neville Longbottom. Dean Thomas. Remus Lupin. Dora Lupin. Teddy Lupin. Luna Lovegood. Colin Creevey, Cho Chang, Cedric Diggory, and Viktor Krum.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"214\">\"Angelina Johnson, my brother's fianc&eacute;e. Katie Bell, Lisa Turpin. All Ravenclaw students, most Hufflepuff students, most Gryffindors. Even some Slytherins. Professor McGonagall, Professor Sprout, Professor Burbage, Professor Trelawney, and Professor Vector,\" Ron continued. \"Dobby the house-elf. Firenze and Magorian, the centaurs. Rufus Scrimgeour and Cornelius Fudge.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"215\">\"Ted and Andromeda Tonks.\" Each name felt like a weight on their soul, but they continued until they listed all the names they could remember. Dumbledore looked horrified and Snape looked arrested.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"216\">\"Emmeline Vance, Elphias Doge, and Amelia Bones,\" Harry paused. \"There are many, many more. People we never even knew who were targeted and killed. I don't even know how many countless Muggles. Almost the entire generation&hellip; Professor Flitwick spoke the eulogy at the mass memorial ceremony, and he said that the entire flower of a generation had been lost. The statistics came later. Some forty percent of the entire Wizarding population was either killed or incapacitated, and that does not include the Muggle-born children who were not allowed to go to Hogwarts; that number is unknown, their bodies never found. All of Hogwarts was awash with blood.&nbsp;<em>The price was too high.</em>\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"217\">There was a very long moment of stunned silence. Snape's face was completely gray, and Dumbledore had his head in his hands.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"218\">\"Always and always is our anthem,\" Ron said. \"It's hard to explain.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"219\">\"It means love, and all the people we love who we&nbsp;<em>will not lose again!</em>\" Harry realized that he was almost shouting. The slender ropes that had bound him had fallen away, and he had risen to his feet without even knowing it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"220\">Dumbledore was at a loss for words, but his eyes shone with fierce pride and hope. Even Snape looked moved; he was gaping at Harry. Ron stood beside him, just as erect, just as proud.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"221\">\"Do you&hellip;\" Dumbledore began. \"I have my suspicions&hellip; but do you know what the rest of the prophecy means?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"222\">\"Whatever you're thinking, you're probably right,\" Ron told him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"223\">\"A bit of his soul was stuck in me. He couldn't die unless&hellip; well, unless I did,\" Harry said. Knowledge too late then, but not now.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"224\">\"Harry survived the Killing Curse again,\" Ron said proudly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"225\">\"So he's definitely made a Horcrux?\" Dumbledore asked. \"I suspected when I saw you after he murdered your parents.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"226\">\"What's a Horcrux?\" Snape asked, lost. Dumbledore explained quickly. \"So that's what Regulus knew&hellip; He said something very odd before he disappeared&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"227\">\"No,\" Harry said. \"He did not make a Horcrux.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"228\">Ron laughed bitterly. \"He made&nbsp;<em>seven</em>&nbsp;Horcruxes, counting Harry.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"229\">\"Oh, Merlin,\" Dumbledore breathed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"230\">Harry withdrew the tiara from the inner pocket of his robes. \"We have one, and we know, roughly, where the others are. I think I might be able to Apparate either of you to one of them, and the others won't be too difficult to manage.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"231\">\"Harry, I think I need some time,\" Dumbledore said quietly. \"Give one week. Please. I need to think about all that you've told me.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"232\">Harry understood. He put the tiara back in his pocket, surprised that he was allowed to do so. Dumbledore was overwhelmed, he could tell. He remembered very clearly how he'd felt when he'd learned that Voldemort had mutilated and maimed himself beyond all usual evil, and how that task had seemed so vast and impossible.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"233\">\"Professors, if I may add one more thing,\" Harry said tentatively. \"There is one name that was not on that list we gave you, a name very important to me.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"234\">Ron stared at Snape. \"You're not going to like it.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"235\">\"I don't think I could possibly be more surprised than I am right now,\" Snape murmured.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"236\">\"Yeah, you can.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"237\">\"My godfather, Sirius Black, currently imprisoned in Azkaban for crimes he did not commit,\" Harry said grimly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"238\">\"You were right, Weasley,\" Snape said after a moment, his lips very thin and his eyes wide. \"I wouldn't think that you, Potter, would forgive the crime of Lily and James' betrayal.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"239\">\"I didn't,\" Harry assured him. \"My dad, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew were all unregistered animagi. They wanted to keep Remus company when he changed. When Sirius hunted Wormtail &ndash; Pettigrew &ndash; down after he sold out my parents to Voldemort, Wormtail was the one who killed the Muggles. He transformed into a rat and escaped through the sewers. And I assure you that I did not forgive him.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"240\">\"Harry killed him eventually,\" Ron said helpfully. \"Harry caught Pettigrew right after the effing rat tortured Minerva McGonagall into insanity.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"241\">\"Let's hope we can find him before he commits that crime,\" Dumbledore said.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"242\">Ron laughed. \"Oh, we know exactly where he is. He's down in my dorm room right now, probably chewing on my sheets.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"243\">\"I need to sit down,\" Snape said.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"244\">Dumbledore shook his head, as though clearing cobwebs, an unguarded gesture that Harry suspected he allowed few to see. \"We need to think of an excuse, Severus. They were right. There will be no expulsion. But we can't allow them to get away with it. None of the teachers would believe it, and I suspect everyone in the whole school knows exactly what happened.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"245\">Snape was silent for so long that Harry began to fear that he would insist on expelling them. His fears were unfounded. \"I suspect that students have been brewing illicit potions,\" he said carefully. \"I know of several that would inspire madness, I suggest the Confuzzle Draught. They will have detention with me every Saturday for a month. And twenty points from Gryffindor, ostensibly because they were stupid to take a potion they didn't know, but really because in a few minutes they will be greeted as heroes in the Gryffindor common room.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"246\">\"Snape knows how to keep us humble,\" Ron said.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"247\">Harry laughed. \"He always did.\"</p>",

Snape's words had come to pass. Harry and Ron had gone back to the common room to find a hero's welcome. They'd been pulled in by the twins who had showered Ron with praise for being a true younger brother to them. The older students had been stunned and impressed, and Harry had felt a little fissure of warmth that even his fellow first years (excepting Hermione) had forgiven them for what Seamus called 'mass projectile vomiting.' A burly fifth year had even congratulated them for what he said was a prank for the ages. Over the past days &ndash; even when it came out that they had run afoul of an illegal potion called the Confuzzle Draught &ndash; their fellow Gryffindors had followed them around in crowds.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"1\">This grated at Snape's temper, and he had said some very vicious things to the two of them that they hoped were only for the sake of appearances. Unfortunately, they couldn't be sure.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"2\">\"Are you sure he's not going to make us disembowel frogs again?\" Ron asked anxiously for the seventeenth time.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"3\">\"No,\" Harry replied, just as anxious. Just yesterday, Snape had called him a four-eyed madman who ought to be put out of his misery.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"4\">They found Snape standing before his desk. On it was a thick cauldron full of what looked like Polyjuice Potion. Did Snape have some sort of humiliating task involving transforming into someone horrible planned?</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"5\">\"No need to give me that look, Potter,\" Snape snapped. \"I'll explain when our guest arrives.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"6\">\"I'm here, Severus,\" said Dumbledore, whipping off an Invisibility Cloak that looked very familiar. \"I arrived just before they did. Allow me to secure the room.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"7\">He then performed some rather complicated spells. Harry recognized most of them; he'd spent enough time in hiding that he was very familiar with spells of protection. But some he didn't.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"8\">\"I should not have let you leave when I did on Monday,\" Dumbledore said quietly. \"I was quite overwhelmed, to be honest. Do you still have the Horcrux?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"9\">\"Yeah,\" Harry brought it out and looked at it with distaste. \"I had it in my trunk.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"10\">\"Was that wise?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"11\">\"Wiser than keeping it on your person,\" Ron muttered darkly. He had certainly not forgotten the influence of the locket; it had led to him abandoning Harry and Hermione. \"Trust me.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"12\">\"If you spend too much time with them they start to change you,\" Harry added, patting Ron on the shoulder. \"I secured my trunk as best I could.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"13\">Dumbledore seemed to accept this explanation and moved on. \"I've been attempting to find a way to speak to you before this, but you always had your admirers with you.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"14\">Snape scowled.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"15\">\"Were you trying to get us mad enough to do something about it in class?\" Ron asked curiously. \"So you could take us to Dumbledore again?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"16\">\"No,\" Snape said shortly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"17\">\"There's so much to ask,\" Dumbledore said ruefully. \"I was obviously not thinking clearly when I told you I needed a week. I regretted that within hours. Tell me&hellip; do you know how to destroy a Horcrux?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"18\">\"Of course,\" Harry said. \"We destroyed all of them. We simply didn't have the means to do so. I thought about going to the Chamber, but we couldn't seem to get away long enough.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"19\">\"And we didn't think you'd want us to unleash Fiendfyre on Hogwarts grounds.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"20\">\"Excellent deduction, Mr. Weasley,\" Dumbledore nodded approvingly. \"Now what is this Chamber?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"21\">\"The Chamber of Secrets,\" Ron replied, as though it was obvious. \"It's got a ruddy Basilisk in it. Harry destroyed his first Horcrux with a fang. Hermione destroyed another one years later the same way.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"22\">\"The Chamber of Secrets?\" Snape asked faintly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"23\">\"They do have a way of bringing myths and fairy tales to life, don't they?\" Dumbledore asked quietly. \"I think we've got our task for the evening, Severus. We'll all go kill the Basilisk.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"24\">\"Actually,\" Harry said, equally quiet. \"We're not sure if that's wise. Certain events&nbsp;<em>must&nbsp;</em>happen the way they happened last time.\" And he told them every detail of it, with Ron's help and input. \"So we think that Ginny has to do it. It has to happen the same way. We can, of course, take every precaution that no one is Petrified. But the Sword of Gryffindor needs to be impregnated with Basilisk venom. That's the only safe way to get rid of the Horcruxes, especially if we're unable to get to the fangs.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"25\">\"That's&hellip; very wise,\" Dumbledore said thoughtfully.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"26\">\"Your portrait helped us,\" Ron told him. \"Ginny will have a coin or something that she'll charm so that the coins Harry and I will carry will send us a message when she starts writing in the diary. Every time.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"27\">\"You don't like this idea,\" Snape said suddenly, staring at Harry.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"28\">\"No, I hate it,\" Harry replied. \"There's a risk, even with every precaution. If I lost Ginny&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"29\">\"They're married,\" Ron said in a stage-whisper.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"30\">\"What's the Polyjuice Potion for?\" Harry asked curiously. It was too weird to talk about his ten year old wife with Dumbledore and Snape listening in.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"31\">\"It's for when we Apparate to the cave you mentioned,\" Snape said. He looked equally grateful for the diversion of topic. \"I think we all agree that this must be done in the utmost of secrecy? I can't be seen anywhere near it. And neither can you,\" He paused. \"Do I want to know how you knew what it was?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"32\">\"We snuck into your personal storeroom last time, nicked the more sensitive ingredients, and used it to infiltrate the Slytherin common room to find out if Draco Malfoy was the Heir of Slytherin,\" Ron grinned. He appeared to be enjoying himself a great deal. Harry couldn't blame him. He was too.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"33\">\"Then we used it when we broke into both the Ministry of Magic and Gringotts,\" Harry informed them, grinning. \"We've used it loads of times.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"34\">\"I think I'll give you another detention just for that,\" Snape said, aggravated.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"35\">\"I think,\" Dumbledore said suddenly. \"That we should spend this detention merely talking. There's so much that we didn't cover&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"36\">Harry and Ron looked at each other, relieved, and began to speak. They told them as much as they could, up until their third year, with the promise of continuing on the following Saturday. But it was growing late, and not even Snape would keep them much longer without arousing protests from the other professors.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"37\">\"I trust you can find a suitable punishment for yourselves?\" Snape raised one eyebrow.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"38\">\"Yeah. I think we just spent the last few hours disemboweling frogs without gloves,\" Ron said. \"And that wouldn't even be a lie, you made us do that once.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"39\">\"In the interest of having a free Saturday sometime before Christmas, I suggest you do not tell him what you did to earn that,\" Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. \"Harry. Take this,\" He held out the Cloak. \"Use it well.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"40\">\"I will,\" Harry promised. \"I'm hungry. I'll use it to sneak into the kitchens.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"41\">HPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHP</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"42\"><em>Dear Ron,</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"43\"><em>The house is ever so much quieter without you here &ndash; I love it! I'm glad to hear that you Sorted into Gryffindor. I'm sure the Hat was debating whether or not to put you in Hufflepuff, and that's why it took so long. Weasleys belong in Gryffindor! I hope I make it too.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"44\"><em>Thanks for the advice about Auntie Muriel, but I like my life. If I stole the tiara, it'd be a toss-up between who would kill me: Mum or Auntie Muriel.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"45\"><em>Dad's doing well. Don't tell Mum, but he finished his project in the shed and he let me take a ride. It was a bit scary being up that high &ndash; thanks to my kind brothers, I've never spent a lot of time on a broom &ndash; and I was glad that there weren't any Whomping Willows again.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"46\"><em>Ron, I hope your wash went all right. We mustn't have you smelling like Fred and George.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"47\"><em>And good for you making friends with Harry Potter, although if you tell him about my crush, I'll hex you. (Mum just read this over my shoulder, and is making me change it). Maybe I won't hex you. But I will be angry at you for always and always if you let him read this letter. Don't even let him touch it!</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"48\"><em>Love,</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"49\"><em>Ginny</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"50\">Ginny was a lot subtler than either Harry or Ron, but it did not take long for Harry grip the parchment in his hands, set his wand against it, and muttered their favorite words.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"51\">\"Always and always.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"52\"><em>My Harry,</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"53\"><em>We've been back for nearly a week and I still can't believe this miracle.

And I'm not even at Hogwarts where I can see more people besides Mum, Dad, and a brother or two. Tell me all about your talk with Dumbledore and Professor Snape. What is this prophecy, and why does everyone know it? You don't think it's anything to really worry about, do you? And, if so, what are we going to do about it? I wanted to ask Mum about it, but what if it's suspicious? Also, she's very, very angry with Ron for the prank the two of you pulled (I'd pay loads of galleons to have been able to watch). If the letter from Dumbledore hadn't arrived soon after Percy's, Ron would've gotten a Howler.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"55\"><em>(Tell Ron to stop reading this now) Harry, I miss you. You did very well at the train station, but that moment you looked at me from the compartment, I just wanted to run to you and hold you. Can you imagine Mum's reaction?

Four years is a long time to wait&hellip;</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"56\"><em>I charmed this parchment (obviously), and I'm writing this in the dead of night. Mum isn't suspicious at all, but she would be if I was to strike up a secret correspondence.

He wished he could take his quill and write her the sort of love letter that he wanted and send Hedwig back to the Burrow, but she was right. Still, he carefully folded the parchment and stuck it in his trunk. He cast a spell to make it look blank, to protect it and keep it safe.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"60\">HPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHP</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"61\">The Saturday detentions went well, although they talked rather than did anything with the Horcruxes. Professor Dumbledore had brought down his Pensieve which made the telling much faster and easier. Not to mention that there might have been miscommunication or misunderstandings; the Pensieve allowed the two older men to view the memories objectively.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"62\">Snape emerged, ashen, one night. \"You could have&nbsp;<em>warned</em>&nbsp;me, Potter! Do you have any idea how bizarre it felt to be flying through the air with no means of support while you two and that Granger girl flew on the back of a dragon?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"63\">\"It felt pretty bizarre to fly on the dragon, actually,\" Harry told him. \"Now how do you two suppose we get the cup from Gringotts?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"64\">They continued in that manner to hone the plan, fine-tune it, and make sure that they left themselves enough leeway to change it if they must. Dumbledore's portrait had been right to insist that they tell his living counterpart. Harry could not imagine doing it any other way. Still, this time around it was different, and Harry was grateful. Dumbledore had been mindful of his childhood, and had sought to protect him, even if Harry had had cause to resent it. This Dumbledore treated Harry as an equal, and Ron too. It was very refreshing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"65\">The only blight on the days leading up to Halloween came from a source that Harry ought to have expected.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"66\">Hermione.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"67\">It bothered Ron quite a lot. He did not like deceiving her (for that matter, neither did Harry), but they couldn't possibly tell her the secret. Not yet, and not for a long time. But whatever misgivings he had about it, Ron's were even worse. He didn't speak of it much, but the look on his face when he stole glances at Hermione was that of wistful longing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"68\">Harry actually looked forward to the troll, the instance that would bind them in friendship. He tried very hard not to think about Hermione aflame.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"69\">But Ron's thoughts were not the only problem. This Hermione still had a keen and penetrating mind, and she was suspicious. She'd grilled them one night for fifteen very uncomfortable minutes outside the library. She asked them to describe the effects of the Confuzzle Draught, to describe exactly where and when they ran into it, and all sorts of leading questions that made Ron break out into a cold sweat.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"70\">\"I don't believe you,\" Hermione said after Harry had stammered out an answer.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"71\">\"<em>Dumbledore&nbsp;</em>believes us!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"72\">\"Yes,\" Hermione said slowly. \"But that doesn't change the facts. I was with you for pretty much the entire day. I didn't see anyone give you a suspicious potion. Besides, the Confuzzle Draught doesn't work for more than thirty minutes. I was walking behind you. And until you stood up and threw Dungbombs, you didn't act at all odd.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"73\">\"Even confuzzled, Snape was a bit frightening, I reckon,\" Harry explained again.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"74\">\"You can't control the confuzzling effects,\" Hermione told them sternly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"75\">\"Listen,\" Harry said. \"Snape just said it was the most likely possibility. Maybe it was some other potion.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"76\">Hermione's mouth twisted with suspicion. \"I don't believe either of you. And I can't&nbsp;<em>imagine</em>&nbsp;why Dumbledore would go along with this.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"77\">\"Snape hates us,\" Ron said flatly. \"He wouldn't try to get us out of trouble by lying! He'd get us&nbsp;<em>into&nbsp;</em>trouble by lying!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"78\">\"No,\" Hermione shook her head. \"You need to be honest. And Ron, don't come to me for help with Transfiguration again.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"79\">She swept away, clutching her books, and looking very formidable for one so young. Harry and Ron watched her go.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"80\">\"I&nbsp;<em>hate&nbsp;</em>this!\" Ron kicked the wall. One of the portraits looked at him reprovingly. He made a face at it. \"I didn't really mean that,\" He said quietly as they walked down the empty hall. \"I just&hellip; I'm looking forward to Halloween.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"81\">\"Me too,\" Harry agreed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"82\">HPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHP</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"83\">Harry looked wistfully out the window toward the Quidditch pitch and wished, for the hundredth time, that he could have justified playing again all through his years at Hogwarts. But he couldn't. He supposed he might have this year &ndash; ensuring that Quirrell did not retrieve the Philosopher's Stone did not really interfere with Quidditch, except in that last match &ndash; but he would not put Ginny in any more danger than he had to, and Quidditch was a distraction he could not afford. He smiled fondly, remembering the blazing argument.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"84\"><em>\"What do you mean you aren't going to play Quidditch because you'd be too worried?\" Ginny asked angrily, tossing her long red hair over her shoulder. \"Ron can be there when you aren't. I don't need to be taken care of, Potter!\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"85\">Yes, you do,&nbsp;<em>thought Harry, but he knew enough not to make his wife even angrier. \"Quidditch will take up too much time. I think it would be dangerous to play, especially during second year.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"86\"><em>\"Dangerous for me, you mean,\" Ginny's eyes narrowed. \"I'm a fairly talented witch, Harry.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"87\"><em>\"Talent has nothing to do with it!\" He shouted suddenly, and her eyes widened. \"Voldemort will be enough of a danger, without his pet. The Basilisk can kill anyone and anything with just a look. And if you think that I'm going to endanger you &ndash; and anyone else, but most especially you &ndash; by flying in the air on a broom while the Basilisk is still alive, you're dead wrong.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"88\"><em>Ginny looked annoyed. \"You just ruined my anger for me.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"89\"><em>\"Good,\" He grinned. \"You know I'm right. You're a very talented witch, love, but you can't speak Parseltongue.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"90\"><em>She hugged him. \"Promise me you won't lock me away to protect me.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"91\"><em>\"Never,\" He said. \"We're in this together. I need you.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"92\">But that was almost four years ago, and Harry hadn't known how much of a disappointment it would be for him to be on the ground while his old team &ndash; plus a small seventh year who played Seeker &ndash; flew high in the sky.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"93\">Today was Halloween, though, and he couldn't afford to let himself be distracted.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"94\">Breakfast was normal; even though Ron fidgeted with nerves and agitation, he still managed to eat enough food that Hermione watched him from a few seats away with a look of disgust on her face. Here was the problem. Ron absolutely refused to say anything to make her cry enough to go hide in the girls' loo. Harry couldn't blame him, but he wished that Ron was a little more pragmatic and a little less chivalrous. Harry would have to do it himself.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"95\">In the end, he didn't have to. Ron betrayed his nerves by sending his feather zooming into the air on his first try with a perfectly executed&nbsp;<em>Wingardium Leviosa</em>. Flitwick clapped his hands, delighted, and gave Gryffindor ten points. Hermione looked angry, but chose not to mention anything until they exited the classroom.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"96\">\"Good job on the charm, Ron,\" She said viciously. \"Think you can do it again to earn enough points for you and Harry to make up for what you did what you were&hellip; confuzzled?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"97\">It was the first time she'd spoken to either of them since the day outside the library. Ron opened his mouth, at a loss for words. Harry was about to say something mean, his insides twisting.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"98\">\"Shut up, know-it-all,\" Lavender Brown said haughtily. \"It wasn't their fault. No wonder you haven't got any friends!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"99\">Several things happened at once. Hermione's face scrunched up and she fled; Harry prayed that she'd find her way to the same loo; and Ron rounded on Lavender with such a look of murderous rage that she stepped back. Harry, hoping to avoid Ron killing Lavender, pulled him away.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"100\">HPHPHPHPHPHPHP</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"101\">\"Remember control,\" Harry whispered very, very quietly to Ron. He appeared to be on the verge of jumping from his seat at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall and running to the girls' loo.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"102\">\"What do&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>know of it?\" Ron snarled. Harry remained unperturbed and Ron's face fell. \"I'm sorry, mate. That was stupid. I'm just worried is all. What if we're too late? What if the troll gets her, or another teacher, and what if she still doesn't like us?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"103\">Harry slowly sipped his water. Not because he didn't want to answer Ron, but because Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan were sitting right across from them. They were laughing and generally carrying on and not one bit suspicious, but Harry was afraid. \"It'll be okay, Ron,\" He murmured finally. \"Hermione won't get hurt. She won't. And if she doesn't start to like us&hellip; we'll wear her down eventually.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"104\">Ten minutes later, Professor Quirrell made his big entrance, shouted about the troll, and fainted. Harry and Ron were the first on their feet and heading toward the door by the time Dumbledore told everyone to follow the prefects back to their common rooms.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"105\">They didn't quite make it to the door fast enough, and soon found themselves jostling for position amongst a sea of children. Harry plowed through, Ron at his side. They didn't have much time to spare; by their reckoning they'd just barely made it the last time. Adrenaline pumped through Harry. He only had one thought as he pushed through the crowd: get to Hermione. Ron, a grim look of determination etched upon his face, was even more single-minded. They detached themselves as quickly and quietly as they could and immediately sprinted to Hermione and the troll.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"106\">They smelled it long before they saw it. They both paused.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"107\">\"Always and always,\" Harry said.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"108\">\"Always and always,\" Ron agreed. Together, they moved forward.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"109\">Both were capable of taking down a troll. A few Bludgeoning Hexes would do it;&nbsp;<em>Sectumsempra</em>&nbsp;certainly would, and there was no doubt that&nbsp;<em>Avada Kedavra</em>&nbsp;could do it as well. The only problem, as they saw it, was that they could not use any of the spells that would effectively stop the troll in its tracks. Hermione would never, ever believe that first years could do it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"110\">So they had to get by on dodging, jumping, and the few spells in the first year arsenal.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"111\">Approximately seven minutes and one stunned troll later, Harry and Ron stood triumphant next to the great, snoring, smelly head while Hermione trembled from underneath a partially demolished sink. Harry was actually surprised by this; they'd had to improvise quite a bit, and the bathroom was in greater disarray than it had been last time. He was relatively unhurt, although one of his fingers stung a bit. Ron was trying not to smirk at his own perfectly executed Wingardium Leviosa.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"112\">\"Are you all right?\" Ron asked Hermione.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"113\">\"Yeah,\" Harry said, he stepped over the trolls head and hovered a few feet away from her. \"Are you?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"114\">\"I-I-I think so,\" Hermione said shakily. \"But what are you doing here?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"115\">\"We came to rescue you,\" Harry said simply. This was a mistake.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"116\">\"And a very stupid idea that was, Potter!\" He whirled around and saw Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick standing in the door. Her lips were pressed tightly together, and they were white around the edges. \"You could have been&nbsp;<em>killed</em>! I can't believe the two of you would be so foolish.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"117\">\"P-p-please, Professor,\" Hermione was sobbing. \"They&nbsp;<em>rescued&nbsp;</em>me!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"118\">\"Be that as it may &ndash;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"119\">Ron then did something both very brave and very foolish. He interrupted Professor McGonagall. \"She could have been killed!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"120\">Harry tried to mask his wince. \"Professor,\" He said pleadingly, and then he lied, \"We didn't know the troll would be here. We just wanted to warn her, and then we saw the troll coming in here&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"121\">Professor McGonagall softened just a tiny bit. \"Be that as it may, Mr. Potter, you ought to have warned a teacher.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"122\">Harry saw Ron open his mouth, but kicked him before he could say anything. He wasn't very gentle about it, either. \"Professor, there just wasn't time. It was mad, and there weren't any teachers in sight.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"123\">Snape appeared out of nowhere behind Professor McGonagall. He gave Harry a small nod; he'd made sure that Quirrell hadn't taken advantage of the distraction to attempt to get to the Stone. Harry bowed his head.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"124\">\"Five points from Gryffindor,\" Professor McGonagall said tightly. \"For Mr. Weasley and Mr. Potter,\" She sighed. \"And ten points to Gryffindor for you both. It was a very foolish thing you did, but not many first years can take on a fully grown mountain troll and win.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"125\">Hermione did not say anything at all as they marched back to their common room. She was still in shock, Harry supposed. They entered, and Harry laughed at the way Ron's eyes lit up when he saw the mounds of food piled on top of the tables.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"126\">\"Thanks,\" Hermione finally said, not looking at either of them, and hurried off to get a plate.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"127\">Harry and Ron grinned at each other, before Ron, rubbing his stomach, moved to do likewise.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"128\">From that moment on, Hermione Granger was their friend again. It was good to know that facing down a mountain troll together was still something the three couldn't experience without becoming friends.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"129\">HPHPHPHPHPHPHPHP</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"130\">Winter came early. November storms rattled the castle, and by early December, Hogwarts was covered in a thick blanket of snow that probably would not melt until spring warmed the frigid air. The Gryffindor Quidditch team, disheartened by the recent loss, continued to practice but did so with little joy. Oliver Wood could be found most evenings sitting in front of the fire, gazing moodily. Harry could tell that he was reliving the last match &ndash; they'd been flattened by Ravenclaw, to Professor Snape's delight. He'd managed to give them several more detentions, and could not seem to stop himself from gloating during their near-weekly meetings.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"131\">Harry lay in his bed one Sunday morning with his curtains drawn. Hedwig had arrived to wake Harry up with a special letter from Ginny concealed in one from Ron. This was only the third she'd been able to send, and Harry felt that Christmas had come a bit early.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"132\"><em>Dear Ron,</em>&nbsp;Ginny wrote.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"133\"><em>There's been a change of plans! We aren't going to Romania this year &ndash; I accidentally destroyed the kitchen with magic (after she finished yelling at me, Mum said that she hadn't seen any accidental magic like it since the twins cut up Percy's pants, and he set their room on fire) so we have to stay behind to repair it and set up all the household spells. Mum says that she'll be too exhausted to go, and Dad agreed. So you're coming home for Christmas after all!</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"134\"><em>Mum decided that I must be lonely, so she said that she's going to have a witch my age come over a few times a week after the holidays. Her name is Luna Lovegood and she'll be at Hogwarts next year too. I don't think I've ever heard about the Lovegoods before, but Mum says they live near us, and that I must be sensitive because this Luna girl just lost her mother. I'm happy that I'll know someone at Hogwarts besides my annoying brothers.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"135\"><em>Not much else is new; life at the Burrow is not quite as exciting as battling a mountain troll! You should've heard Mum. I'll bet she gives you a firm talking-to once you get home, so if I were you, I wouldn't be too excited. Dad's dead proud, though. I'm glad to hear that you are making new friends. This Hermione girl sounds very nice, even if she's got bad taste in friends.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"136\"><em>See you at Christmas!</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"137\"><em>Love,</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"138\"><em>Ginny</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"139\">Harry hurriedly read through the note, then tapped the parchment with his wand, muttering, \"Always and always.\" The real letter appeared in short order.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"140\"><em>My Harry,</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"141\"><em>It was very difficult to destroy the kitchen without it looking deliberate, let me tell you. And I feel horribly guilty about it, but I couldn't stand waiting all the way to summer without seeing you. It has already been too long. Did you know that this is the longest we've been parted since the Burrow was destroyed? I'm sure you do, but I think about it every day. Mum will forgive me once she realizes why I did it, although I'm vexed at her (and yet mindful that I have a mother to be vexed at again). I kept trying to ask her about Voldemort, but she keeps putting me off and telling me I'm too young. I know it's unfair of me &ndash; she couldn't possibly know that I'm really almost thirty years old, and as wonderful as it is to have my parents and my childhood home again, I can't help but feel impatient to get to Hogwarts and to help you and Ron. We'll think of a way to sneak off and you can tell me everything that Mum hasn't.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"142\"><em>Mum finally took the bait and suggested that Luna would be a good playmate over the next few months. I can't wait to see her &ndash; I'll bet she's even crazier as a child! Make sure that Ron knows to be very careful with his words around her. Remember the keen mind obscured by the battiness. I'll bet you that if any of our friends figure it out before we tell them, it'll be Luna. Hermione's brilliant, but you know she'd never suspect something so ludicrous as time travel.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"143\"><em>Speaking of Hermione, I'm so very glad that the three of you are friends once more. I knew the troll would do it, despite Ron's misgivings. Harry, I can guess what you see when you look at her, but try not to let the flames obscure the reality. She's here, she's alive, and so are we. She and Ron will get married and give us nieces and nephews to love.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"144\"><em>I love you, Harry. I'll see you in two weeks (and we'll discuss a compromise on the four year thing).</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"145\"><em>Always and always,</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"146\"><em>Ginny</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"147\">Harry smiled and folded the letter, placing it with the others she'd managed to send. It wasn't easy for her, he knew. She couldn't have any idea when he and Ron would send letters to her, and she'd find it hard to explain why she spent so much time thinking about a simple note to her brother. It was enough that she'd managed to steal one of her parents' wands several times to charm the parchment. He ached to see her, and it was like a knot in his belly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"148\">He, Ron, and Hermione had been quite busy since Halloween and the return of their friendship. They'd spent time without her with Hagrid during the weeks that she'd ignored them. A few days after Halloween they'd told her everything they \"knew\" about the theft at Gringotts, the three-headed dog named Fluffy, and what they thought it was guarding. She was now in the thick of it right along with them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"149\">\"But who is Nicolas Flamel?\" She'd asked, frustrated, yesterday morning at breakfast. \"I know I've heard that name before! But he isn't in any of the books I've studied in the library.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"150\">Harry and Ron just shook their heads, pretending to be just as confused as she. \"We'll keep looking, Hermione,\" Ron told her. \"Meanwhile, we've got to find out who is trying to steal it.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"151\">This time around, they'd decided not to accuse Snape.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"152\">Things were moving just as slowly with Snape and Dumbledore. The tiara had been destroyed, at least, for which Harry was very grateful. Dumbledore had taken it outside Hogwarts grounds in early December and had performed several complex experiments upon it. He'd wanted to discover another, less dangerous way of destroying it besides resorting to Fiendfyre, and without having to be dependent upon the Sword of Gryffindor or the highly poisonous Basilisk fangs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"153\">Nothing seemed to work, and finally (after telling Harry and Ron, who were 'serving another detention,' to stand well back) had destroyed the vile object with an awe-inspiring display of dragons and chimeras made of flame.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"154\">The Horcrux, now broken and free of the bit of soul Voldemort had placed in it, was placed in a shelf in Dumbledore's office.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"155\">So it was with good humor that Harry made his way down to the Great Hall several days before the Christmas holidays were set to begin. Ron had written his mum directly after receiving Ginny's note, and while an answer had not come back yet (he'd used Errol instead of Hedwig), both Harry and Ron were certain that the soft-hearted matriarch of the Weasley clan would not deny an orphan.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"156\">\"HARRY!\" Ron shouted. He was standing on his chair and beaming. Even Hermione, seated next to him, was smiling. \"You're coming home with us for Christmas!\"</p>",

Red tops!\" Yells the old man on the corner of a dark Bristol street, limping to and fro on the cobbled lane.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"10\">Get your Red Tops. All of them here, all of them now. Just a simple call, vague and unassuming, and like clockwork, denizens of the night yet unseen rise from their hovels and homes made of rubble like the living dead, all for a chance to get some of those Red Tops. They stalk and stumble in the nighttime shadows, passing through and around the tout, never seeing who he is as they continue their mad rush to oblivion. Further on, five men; two white, two black, one of some race not quite identifiable, await the coming sales with uncaring glowers as bright a volatile as the glowing tips of the cigarettes they suck like life-giving water.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"11\">A young man, seeming to be in his early twenties with jet black hair that stuck up in all corners and astonishingly green eyes, looks upon the scene impassively.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"12\">Harry Potter never thought he would see this day: fourteen wizards and witches, befallen some terrible stroke of fate or un-luck line up next to a great brick wall as these five men, no doubt wizards themselves, look them up and down. The Fiends, that's what the Magical Law Enforcement Agents call them, wear simpering smiles to get a taste, a little inkling of the great and mighty Red Top. They hold out fat gold coins, and Harry briefly wonders what half of them had to do for that money, which the men with cigarettes grab at greedily, having them throw it into a large, and no doubt charmed, rubbish bag.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"13\">One of the men's eyes flick towards the tout, a choleric, sallow-faced, middle-aged white man with graying straw-blond hair a few sparse hairs lining his jaw in what might be called an excuse for a beard, and tosses a number of those fat gold coins to the man.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"14\">Harry feels a pressure in his stomach, that snake-in-the-belly come back for another meal. It has been coming on and off for the entire day. Quickly, before he can even have the chance to think about it, Harry pulls a pack of cigarettes from his jacket and lights one quickly, taking a long and deep drag, looking into the carton.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"15\">There are only two cigarettes left. He will have to conserve.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"16\">The tout whom has just earned four galleons, the large gold coins Harry had seen being exchanged, returns the corner and looks directly at the raven-haired wizard as he calls for any last Red Top-hopefuls. \"Red Tops! Red Tops!\" He again cries out. The fourteen wizards and witches are being handed small vials of some liquid, viscous material of a chartreuse color, plugged by a red stopper.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"17\"><em>Agilian</em>, is the word that comes to Harry's mind as the vials exchange hands. Agilian, the new wonder-drug of the wizarding world. With an economy in shambles due to Voldemort's power play about four years ago, it comes as no surprise to the Potter that drugs have become the go-to for many a down-on-their-luck wizards. Hermione Granger calls it a 'travesty' that all these people have turned to chemical happiness over trying to fulfill their lives in 'constructive ways', but Harry can understand their pain. He saw first-hand the horrors of the war, and how it affected those around him psychologically. Perhaps Hermione is much stronger than the rest of England, because Harry has seen people change entirely.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"18\">Some for the better in Draco Malfoy, Harry's one-time enemy, who saw firsthand the torments that Voldemort had afflicted on his family. Naturally, that had given the young man things to think about. And when Harry and Draco found themselves in Auror School, with Harry a year above and abusing Time Turners as if there were no tomorrow, they had both realized that they were not so different. But far more often, Harry knows, people are changed for the worse. That is state of affairs after a costly and damaging war. They lose their homes, their families, their fortunes, and who wouldn't like to numb that pain just a little bit? Magic is at a loss when it comes to that; there are numerous spells to harm others, but no spells for pleasure. Here, Potions come in handy, and Agilian is the latest wonder-potion to be abused by the rich and poor alike.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"19\">So the question begs to ask again: Who&nbsp;<em>wouldn't</em>&nbsp;like to numb the pain just a little bit?</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"20\">Harry would know, as he shares the same vice as the fourteen wizards and witches, now assembling into a small coterie, discussing the Agilian package as if it were the daily mail.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"21\">But, not today, not now. Harry has places to be besides a dark, dank, Bristol Corner.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"22\">He slips away from the shadows he has been standing in and moves onward into more favorable territory, though not much better. Bristol has become, perhaps, the filthiest city in the UK for wizards after the War. While the muggle areas remain relatively unchanged, the Wizarding Section has not, considering Harry has left a drug corner and now finds himself stumbling upon a bordello.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"23\">But, fortunately, he has no business there, either, and spares the large tavern-esque building no more than a passing glance. Where he needs to go is farther away, and similar to the brothel, but a little more dodgy. So, into the inner-city Harry goes, seemingly unaffected by the moral decay around him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"24\">No one really had understood why Harry chose to move to Bristol from London little over a month ago. Ginny Weasley, Harry's now ex-girlfriend, was not entirely happy with the move. Of course, she plays it off well. The Weasley says she never liked Bristol, and so she would not be moving in with him. Privately, the Weasley told Harry that he was far too obsessive about his job. 'To the point where it seems like it's an addiction' she had told him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"25\">Maybe it is an addiction. He does very much enjoy catching dark wizards.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"26\">Harry cuts across an alleyway, stumbling out to another depressing street, but closer to his destination. Mrs. Weasley, Ginny's mother, is also rather unhappy with Harry's sudden aloofness, taking it upon herself to bring the Potter back into the fold and get him reacquainted with her one and only daughter. Fortunately, he has cut out all means of communication, what with multiple anti-apparition wards around his flat and purposefully searching for an apartment without a fireplace, to make it impossible to floo. In fact, irony of ironies, the only way to contact Harry Potter when he is away from office is by a bit of muggle technology: the mobile phone. Most of his subordinates avoid using them, as Ron finds the 'blighted things' too hard to use and Draco deems the technology beneath the grace of being used by his aristocratic hands.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"27\">The only person who does, in fact, endeavor to contact Harry in the preferred manner is Hermione. And, judging by the chirping of his mobile, said woman is calling him right now. Harry picks up:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"28\">\"Hermione,\" he quietly says into the receiver.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"29\">\"Harry,\" she greets, sounding rather content, \"Would you like to join Ron and I for a drink?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"30\">Harry snorts. \"You do realize I live a hundred and fifteen miles from you two, right?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"31\">Well. One-hundred fifteen from Ron, one-hundred twelve from Hermione's.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"32\">Said witch snickers. \"You do realize you're a wizard with the capability of Apparition, right?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"33\">\"No. It actually didn't occur to me.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"34\">\"Figures,\" Hermione chides playfully, \"Why did you get that flat anyways? I thought you liked London. Your place before was nice. Your new flat's all cramped and-\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"35\">\"-Cozy,\" Harry corrects; he can almost see his friend's grin at the other end of the line.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"36\">\"Hm. I suppose,\" she replies, sounding like she doesn't believe it, \"but, still, why?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"37\">\"Closer to work,\" Harry grunts.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"38\">\"That's the worst lie I've ever heard. You work at the OIM. In London. Not Bristol.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"39\">Ah, yes, the Old Irish Metre, or OIM. Where all Aurors have moved post-Voldemort. Harry hasn't a clue why it they named it so, only that the new Minister had chuckled and said something about the Muggle Police when he'd heard the name.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"40\">\"Who said it was for that kind of work?\" Harry questions lightly. Hermione pauses, he can sense confusion at the other end of the line:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"41\">\"Then for what kind of work?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"42\">Harry puts on a deliberately mysterious tone. \"To rid the world of evildoers.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"43\">Hermione laughs, but says nothing, so Harry continues: \"Actually I've got a ton of real work to do tonight. DSI Granath has been up the arse for my reports, and seeing as Ron doesn't actually know how to write, I've been stuck with all of them. You two enjoy your night, I'll probably be dead tired by the time I'm finished anyway.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"44\">\"You could bring the reports over, I could help you.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"45\">Harry stiffens a reflexive smile into a thin frown; it would be like Hermione to suggest helping on Auror reports. \"Auror protocol, Granger. Can't show you any of our reports.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"46\">\"Oh,\" she remarks, \"But, Ron-\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"47\">Harry knows Ron uses Hermione as his personal scribe, or at least his editor, considering the near professional-quality reports that end up on Granath's desk, something Harry's Ginger-haired friend is not known for. \"That's because Ron's an idiot. And it's not Department Protocol. He's going to get dinged on that someday if he isn't careful.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"48\">\"I know, I know, Harry. 'Tell him to be more careful and to stop being stupid'.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"49\">Harry nods. \"You know me too well. Have a nice night. And don't let Ron drink too much, I can't have him at work all bottle-ached.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"50\">\"I'll make sure to tell him, mum,\" Hermione sighs, sounding wonderfully discontented.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"51\">Harry smiles. \"Thank you.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"52\">\"Bye,\" she responds, sounding mildly disappointed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"53\">\"Bye.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"54\">Harry snaps the phone shut and continues his trek.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"55\">He passes a few more streets, and a few more dealers with their touts advertising their own Agilian-concoction: 'Black Heads'; 'Fat Man', after the muggle nuclear weapon; 'The Queen'; so on and so forth. Harry, once again, feels a little pang in his stomach, but the cigarette does its job and keeps the snake away.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"56\">Finally, in the distance, Harry spots the building he is looking for: A small tavern with a painted sign overhead, which reads: 'Basilisk Fang'. Harry thinks the name sounds stupid, but he continues towards its large, open, oaken door and steps inside. Fortunately, through use of a glamour charm, very few people will recognize the famous Harry Potter. Besides, it likely wouldn't be good for the image if Harry was found hanging around this area of the city.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"57\">The Tavern, as one would expect in this area of Bristol, is as dodgy as the corners that surround it. It appears to Harry that some of the prostitutes from outside have expanded their business into the saloon, seeking the next drunkard, honing in on him like prey. And, as tempting as cheap firewhiskey and whores sounds to the Auror, he decides against his feebler judgment and remains concentrated on his task, seeking the small door in the back where a large, intimidating bouncer steers away any drunk fellows.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"58\">\"An Uzi? What the fuck kind of muggle plonker does that shortarse thing he is?\" A patron, red-faced, and clearly drunk exclaims, \"We're in Bristol, not fucking Los Angeles!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"59\">Harry ignores the man's foul mouth, rubs his eyes, a docile blue color, now, due to the glamour charm, and marches up to the bouncer:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"60\">\"I'm looking for The Broker,\" he says quietly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"61\">The bouncer eyes Harry, seeing only a blond-haired, blue-eyed man staring back at him. \"'Uh dun' know no Broker.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"62\">\"Sure you do,\" Harry replies, \"he's a good bloke.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"63\">\"'E's a dead bloke.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"64\">\"Well, you know what they say: 'Dead gods will not save you', and all. Now let me in.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"65\">The Bouncer's back stiffens with the 'Dead gods' comment. He straightens out and leans back into the door as it magically opens behind him. \"Be quick,\" is all the man says, moving aside so Harry can step through.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"66\">From the outside of the building, one would be hard-pressed to imagine that this area of the Tavern even exists. Strangely, Harry feels somewhat like he's entered a shop owned by quite a dedicated Voodoo Priest. There is a faint musty order in the air, and the lights are dimmed, for mood, no doubt. Harry steps inside uncertainly as the room seems to grow darker in his presence. A sneakoscope on a far away shelf, next to what Harry thinks might be an actual human skull, reflects Harry's image back at him. As is etiquette with The Broker, one must wait at the oddly shaped front desk of his, displaying all sorts of unsavory trinkets and what appears to be a plethora of muggle firearms.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"67\">\"You know, I'm surprised that glamour charm fools anyone,\" a voice emerges from the darkness, \"You can't hide your magic&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;well, Harry.\" A tall, beautiful woman emerges from a bead-curtain from a doorway off to the far-right of the room.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"68\">\"Perhaps not, Helene, but, then again, a simple glamour charm can't hold up to a live Metamorphmagus, can't it?\" Harry counters, dispelling his charm, eyes and hair reverting back to their original green and black.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"69\">Helene de Beauvoir, a English-born French witch of about thirty-two, steps out into the dim light of the room, long, lustrous black hair trailing behind her as she turns her eyes a bright, vivid green. \"Yes. That's true. We're like twins, now.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"70\">\"Fantastic,\" Harry drawls. Helene cocks her head, before shifting her features once more, to her normal auburn hair and ice-blue eyes. Even without the use of her abilities, Harry admits that the woman is shockingly pretty.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"71\">\"Please don't tell me you want more guns,\" she sighs, \"I'm running very low, and it takes quite some time to magick them as you want.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"72\">\"Not tonight, Helene,\" Harry waves a hand dismissively. \"Just information.\" Helene is, perhaps, the best information broker in all of England, and it is no contest who's at the top in Bristol. Her company, however, is usually a lot more&nbsp;<em>unsavory</em>&nbsp;than the raven-haired Auror, so she wears a lazy grin:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"73\">\"My, aren't we investing in clich&eacute;s tonight?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"74\">\"What?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"75\">\"Never mind,\" the woman huffs, before grinning and splaying her arms outwards, a tad theatrically. \"What is it that the Great Harry Potter needs? Your wish, as they say, is my desire.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"76\">\"I-\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"77\">\"No, wait,\" Helene brings a finger to her chin in a thoughtful expression, \"That Savernake Murder from this morning. The Prophet says it's a sign of things to come. Purebloods and Muggleborns at the center of it. Tell that Healer friend of yours to watch out.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"78\">Harry never did like it when Helene mentioned his friends. He hopes they don't continue down that line of discussion.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"79\">\"Never mind her,\" Harry replies, \"I had a feeling this morning that the murder took place in an iron-smelting foundry.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"80\">\"Using his talents again?\" Helene cryptically interrupts. \"You know better than to do that-\" she paused, and let out a long-suffering sigh, \"-Tell me exactly what you saw this morning.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"81\">Harry eyes Helene warily, but she has never been anything but helpful, so he takes a deep breath and recounts his story:</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"82\"><em>August 26, 2002<br /></em><em>Savernake Forest, Wiltshire, UK</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"83\">\"We're close, mate. We're so bloody close.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"84\">\"I don't know about that. Look, we've got another body reported, that can't possibly be good can it?\" Harry replied to a young man with shock-red hair, \"But, we can't let ourselves get too involved, can we?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"85\">\"Yeah, I reckon you're right,\" the taller man, the redhead, said whilst scratching his forehead and stepping over fallen branches, \"I just want to get this case wrapped up in time for Hermione's birthday.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"86\">\"I'll try, but this case has been ongoing for months, and looks like we're getting closer, but who the hell knows if we'll catch him by then,\" the raven-haired wizard replied, \"Some pureblood circles are telling us to just leave them be. He'll be in the wind once the Hogwarts Express leaves in four days, anyways.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"87\">\"Arseholes, the lot of them!\" taller man spat, \"But, you know Hermione. She's a muggleborn, she can't stand for all this backlash and... I'd feel much better if we could put this behind us by her birthday.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"88\">The taller man, named Ronald Weasley, jammed his hands into his pockets and leaned against one of the trees, trying to seek shade from the dripping water. He let out a wistful sigh and stared up into the sky, no doubt thinking about the coming birthday. However, a light slap to the temple broke him from his reverie before it can even start:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"89\">\"Ow, bloody hell, Harry! What was that for?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"90\">Harry snorted. \"Look lively, Ron. Everyone's favorite healer can wait until&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;the case.\" Harry, apparently satisfied with his warning, turns and stalks away to another part of the forest where more people gather.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"91\">\"Bleedin' mental,\" Ron said, doing his best to sound cross but sounding more comical than anything, rubbed his temple as he follows Harry.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"92\">It might have taken a pause to survey how strange a scene like this unfolded in this nondescript forest: a total of twelve people in robes and armor stood around a small and rancid hunk of meat laying at the epicenter of the circle of druids. Though at one point in his life, very long ago, Harry might have been frightened by the strange, shadowy men by the rotting carcass, he was no longer, and took long strides, splattering up mud and broken twigs as he reached the first of the robed men:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"93\">\"Longbottom!\" Harry barked, noticing an equally tall man wrapped in new maroon robes, contrasting from the well-worn and slightly tattered black robes of Ron and Harry's. The man in the maroon robes turns around and levels a curious eye at Harry:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"94\">\"DCI,\" he replies respectfully, folding his arms behind his back in the traditional Army stance.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"95\">Harry's hard countenance softened. \"No need for the respect with me, Neville. I'm still Harry, remember?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"96\">\"Right, Harry,\" Neville Longbottom replied, relaxing his stance, before turning and urging the two newcomers to follow, \"We've got another body. It's that girl who went missing mid-August: Dana James. Fits with our man's&nbsp;<em>Modus Operandi</em>; severing of the arms, genital mutilation, and the use of a muggle-method of killing, known as Glasgow Smile-\" Neville suddenly stops. Harry and Ron pause with him:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"97\">\"What is it?\" Ron asked.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"98\">Neville looked around, shrinking under his hood. \"It's just that... that sounded a bit... clinical.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"99\">Ron snorts, and looked like he was about to say something sarcastic when Harry laid a reassuring hand on Neville's shoulder: \"It always sounds a bit more clinical each time. But remember, it affects you no less.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"100\">Neville smiled and nodded at Harry's lie. Better to believe for right now that the shock of finding a mutilated body never subsides. Harry knew, being an Auror longer than many of the young men at this crime scene, that it just happened some day.&nbsp;<em>You just stop feeling anything for the body in front you</em>, Harry thought,<em>&nbsp;and it becomes just that, a body</em>. But, the man in front of him had always been a sentimental and kind young man, and perhaps Neville could be the one to surprise him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"101\">Harry, quite rightly, doubted it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"102\">But it got Neville to move on quickly. \"Malfoy is inspecting the body right now. Sorry. No one from St. Mungo's yet.\" Neville nods to Ron apologetically. Draco and Ron have never gotten along well. And for most of that period, neither did Harry.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"103\">While Harry and Draco got along much better these days, it took no great leap of logic to say there is no love lost between the said blond and redhead. Throughout their years at Hogwarts, Draco tormented Hermione Granger, Ron's then-friend and now-girlfriend, mercilessly for being a Muggleborn witch. Harry or Ron would come to her defense, and then Malfoy would make fun of them, and then Hermione would come to their defense... and so on went the vicious cycle. Harry and Draco were able to bury the hatchet due to an extended mission in Romania two years ago. Some of the muggle technology left the normally nominally racist pureblood in awe.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"104\">The same, however, could not be said of Malfoy-Weasley relations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"105\">\"Bleedin' Malfoy,\" Ron grit his teeth; Harry chuckled.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"106\">\"He's not so bad, not anymore, at least,\" Harry replied, \"still a git, yes, but we're on the same side, now, right?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"107\">\"That doesn't change that he is a gargantuan tosser,\" the Ginger-haired wizard replied.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"108\">\"Naturally,\" Harry deadpanned.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"109\">\"I feel so loved,\" a bored drawl came from off to the side. Harry turned to see the handsome, but sneering, pale face of Draco Malfoy staring back at him. \"DCI Potter, this way, please. We've got the girl here. As Longbottom says, definite mutilation, and, of course, she's a Mud-<em>Muggleborn</em>.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"110\">Ron leveled a furious glare at Draco, who simply shrugged:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"111\">\"I don't mean to offend,\" he apologized in a tone that did not make him sound like he meant it, \"I had forgotten you and Granger were an... an&nbsp;<em>item</em>. Truth be told, I had expected her and the Great Potterini to start shagging years ago.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"112\">Ron's face began to turn a purple color and Harry had the decency to blush.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"113\">\"Thought&nbsp;<em>for sure</em>&nbsp;you two were a better match,\" Draco continued to mock the Weasley, rapidly becoming furious, by speaking to Harry. \"Granger is such an idealist. Bloody annoying, but one thing I cannot deny is that she's&nbsp;<em>clever</em>. To think she'd end up shacking up with the Boy-Who-Puked-Slugs, who wouldn't know the difference between a wand and his gentleman-sausage! She's gotten fairly pretty, too. Pity, really. You missed out, Potter.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"114\">\"Detective-Inspector,\" Harry warned Draco, now chuckling lightly at Ron's expense, \"Would you like to be sent home from&nbsp;<em>another</em>&nbsp;case?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"115\">\"Not really,\" the blond replied spryly, \"Astoria's being quite annoying as of late. She's been wanting me to buy her that bloody ring.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"116\">Despite Draco's blais&eacute; response, Harry knew the blond was quite at loathe to return to his London residence that he and his girlfriend, Astoria Greengrass, shared. And despite that the younger Slytherin chose a career in Pediatric Healing, there were rumors she had learned quite a few nasty hexes from her sister, Daphne, another Auror whom Harry had heard was working in the Anti-Terrorist Department.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"117\">Needless to say, if Astoria was displeased with her boyfriend in any way, she could throw around a few jinxes of her own.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"118\">Having known this, Harry smiled smugly. \"Then I would advise you to shut it.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"119\">Malfoy, clearly disappointed with the brevity of his latest bout of Weasley-baiting, tried to salvage some pleasure out of the situation by sending one last pleased look at Ron before leading the trio, Harry, Ron, and the normally quiet Neville Longbottom to the body. It was covered by a white tarpaulin that Harry found himself rather at loathe to remove. But, this was his job, after all; exchanging a look with Ron, they both grasped a corner of the heavy cloth and lifted it off the rotting husk, a putrid scent assaulting their senses almost immediately. Harry took one look at the face of what once was a cherubic young girl and shook his head. Ron closed his eyes and took a steadying breath.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"120\">\"Horrifying,\" Neville remarked quietly, looking at the body.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"121\">\"How long has it been here?\" Harry asked.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"122\">\"Nothing solid yet without an autopsy,\" Malfoy answered, \"But I'd venture to guess, based off decomposition alone, anywhere from three-to-five days.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"123\">Harry ran a few diagnostic tests. Once finished, he groaned. \"No information whatsoever. Pretty much the entirety of the torture was done without magic.\" The tarpaulin was replaced to keep the smell at bay.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"124\">Malfoy snorted. \"A Muggleborn-hating Pureblood using muggle means to torture his victims. I don't know whether to call him a genius or a hypocrite.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"125\">Harry raised an amused eyebrow.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"126\">\"Er... a genius in a de Sade sort of way,\" the blond quickly amended.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"127\">Harry grinned; Neville and Ron simply looked confused, now. \"Genius and psychoticism are not the same thing,\" the DCI said.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"128\">\"Thin line between, Potter,\" Draco smirked.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"129\">The DCI crouched to get a better look at the face. The cutting was done with an enchanted knife, he was sure, feeling out the trace elements of magic. It was a gory scene, and Harry brought up a gloved hand to his nose to keep out the slightly rancid scent of the little girl's body. With a soft, but audible pop, Harry felt another presence coming up behind him:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"130\">\"Healer Granger,\" he drawled lazily, lifting up the cloth to get a better look at the girl. Her torso waspockmarked with angry slash marks, and her chest was in even worse shape. It looked rather like a dog attacked her, instead of a wizard. The cuts were greenish-yellow, either the sign of some insidious magic, or a natural infection of her wounds. Truthfully, Harry would have rather not looked down any further, and leave the rest of the quick autopsy to the Healer who had just Apparated behind him:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"131\">\"Another one,\" her soft voice returned, no hurt or shock, just resigned acceptance.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"132\">Harry nodded slowly, staring at the girl's terrified, lifeless eyes: \"Another one,\" he echoed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"133\">As he surveyed the more obvious wounds, Harry finds feeling a strange urge. A snake in his stomach, curling, and coiling from its long slumber. It is hungry, it needs to be satiated. He knew what this meant, and tries to ignore it, even though he knows the snake-in-the-belly will only hiss louder the longer he pays it no mind. In only fifteen seconds, he was already sweating and his hands are shaking. This does not go unnoticed by his Healer friend:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"134\">\"Harry?\" Hermione asked; Harry refuses to meet her eyes, \"Are you okay?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"135\">No. He was not. But he would be. All he needed was one cigarette. Just to take the edge off. Just to... \"Sorry, Hermione,\" he replied, feeling that snake in the pit of his gut slithering around, yearning for release. \"I'm dying for the day's first tab.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"136\">Hermione made a face. \"You know those will kill you, right? Bad for teeth, too.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"137\">\"Least of my worries,\" Harry replied lightly, pulling a pack from inside his robes. He peered inside the open carton, finding thirteen death sticks sitting inside. Not good, but he knew its better than the alternative. \"Besides, I'm not trying to attract anyone.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"138\">Harry conjured a flame with his wand and lit the cigarette, taking a long drag, feeling the snake in his belly slink away, moderately satisfied for now. Suddenly, he felt more acutely aware, as if his mind was roused from previous sluggishness to peak performance. Harry took another gander at the body, and sniffed the air, noticing something he had not earlier:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"139\">\"I'm thinking this one was killed at some sort of foundry,\" Harry observed, pinching his nose. \"Probably one that was recently abandoned.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"140\">\"Foundry?\" Ron quipped suddenly, \"Why a foundry?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"141\">\"You can smell it on her,\" Harry replied, releasing his nose, \"Sulfur Dioxide. She must have been inhaling it. Granger, during the autopsy, would you mind having the on-call Pathologian inspect the inside of the lungs as well? It must be littered with the stuff. There aren't too many places in England that would have that kind of gas floating around except iron foundries. Which would give me Doncaster and Bristol as possible perpetrators. Leaves London out-\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"142\">\"-why?\" Asked Ron.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"143\">\"Too much suspicion there. The entire Ministry of Magic operates in the middle of London. Too many people, too many opportunities of escape and being caught. Bad if you're caught by the Muggle Police; worse if wizards catch onto your plan. Any sensible person would avoid the biggest city center in the UK.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"144\">\"Respectfully, DCI-\" Neville cut in whilst Harry is in mid-thought, but the Chief Inspector paid the rookie Auror no mind and plowed onwards:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"145\">\"That leaves Bristol and Doncaster. Doncaster is too far, and it would make little sense to hide a body in Savernake Forest if one were in that city. There are better places to hide a body nearer to Doncaster...\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"146\">\"But, DC-\" Neville tried again, looking helplessly from a rather astounded Hermione to Malfoy, and then to Ron, whom spoke up:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"147\">\"Don't bother, Nev. He's not speaking to us. Harry gets like this sometimes. I don't know where his mind goes, but somehow he always comes up with something relevant. Besides, even if you tried to stop him, he'd just continue on as if you weren't even there.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"148\">\"Really?\" Neville intoned; Draco let out a rather undignified snort:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"149\">\"Once, I left for lunch while he got like this, an hour later, I come back to find him carrying on about the same subject as if I were in the room the whole time.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"150\">\"...should probably test the soil on her trainers for heavy metals if so,\" Harry continued to himself, stalking off from the group and staring off into the distance, \"Bristol's contaminated soil treatment facilities should have a lot of them nearby, maybe a foundry nearby an CSTE...\" he pauses, staring off into the distance. The other members of his team not the sudden stop:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"151\">\"What's wrong with him, now?\" Neville questioned and Ron shrugged in response:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"152\">\"He's thinking,\" the redhead replied, \"I don't know, something about Auror Training School changed him. He was a smart bloke before, but he's scary brilliant when he wants to be, now.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"153\">\"Hermione,\" Harry called, suddenly, causing the previously confused brunette to snap to attention, \"you might know this. What is that tree over there?\" Harry points to a large and ancient-looking tree with a blue sign planted in front of it.

I'm already loopy,\" Harry says, smiling, making a pretend-handgun with his fingers, putting it to his temple, and proceeding to fire. Helene smiles:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"190\">\"Fatalism.

A few moments later, she comes out with two vials filled with a deep, forest-green liquid, \"You must take these. For the symptoms\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"193\">Harry's face sours. \"I don't want that. I can't use that anymore.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"194\">\"Harry,\" Helene pleads, pressing the two vials into his outstretched palm, \"You've got the shakes, the rumblies in your gut, and pretty soon the headaches are going to come. This is the only way to calm them!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"195\">\"No, no,\" Harry shakes his head, reaching into his coat-pocket and pulling out the near-empty carton of cigarettes. \"I've got all I need.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"196\">\"You stupid man! And, what? Huffing a pack of fags every day is somehow helpful? And when you're forty and crippled by cancer?\" The elder witch hisses, \"You have to take this. Remember, this is my own concoction, and it's the only thing that will keep you in check.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"197\">\"It's illegal,\" Harry murmurs, knowing it is terrible excuse.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"198\">Helene snorts. \"Come off it, Harry, even you know that's a bad excuse.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"199\">Harry relents, taking the vials. \"Your own formula, you say?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"200\">\"My very own. I call it 'The Green Light'; the purest, finest Agilian you'll ever come across. It'll make you feel&nbsp;<em>alive and free</em>. Because you're unburdening your mind. You take that, and you'll be yourself in no time.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"201\">\"At what cost?\" Harry asks, smiling ruefully.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"202\">\"Oh, do&nbsp;<em>shut it</em>, Harry!\" The elder woman snarks, slapping at his arm lightly, before unlocking the door and seeing Harry off. \"Have a good night.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"203\">\"You too,\" Harry responds, finding himself back out into the raucous atmosphere of the Basilisk Fang Tavern. Rather unhappily, he puts the two vials of Agilian in his coat pocket and heads out of the building. The warm, blustery wind caresses Harry's cheek as he looks around at the many corners, dealers on one side, whores on the other.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"204\">He sighs. \"Verily,\" he remarks, feeling a bit philosophical, \"these are my people.\"</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"205\"><em>August 27, 2002 7:36 A.M.<br /></em><em>Bristol, UK</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"206\">Harry is entranced. So, so, very entranced. The miracle of nature that stands before him, with its gnarls and curves and great branches, rising up to the mottled gray sky above, has left him in quite the state. He tries to say something, but no words come out. He just listens to the soft, crooning sound of the birds, and looks at the great tree, there like an immortal statue, fashioned by nature itself to say 'This is the beauty I can create'.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"207\">And, Nature, despite its terrific egoism, is correct about that one thing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"208\">Harry reaches down and touches the turquoise sign in front of him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"209\">\"The King of Limbs,\" he breathes out, almost in awe, reading the words off the small sign in front of him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"210\">There is a distant calling, a voice he recognizes almost instantly, but in the gloaming, he doesn't care for his partner's yells and screams for Harry to identify himself. There is just the King of Limbs. And that feeling. Like there's ginger ale sloshing around violently in his head. Everything turns to mush. He forgets to breathe. Darkness creeps in on the corner of his eyes. And he briefly experiences the sense of falling, like the time he and Hermione visited Avon Gorge in Bristol and stared down at the sheer vertical drop into the waters from Clifton Bridge, and hitting something in a loud and painful thud, before the darkness envelopes everything and anything he sees.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"211\">When he comes to, Harry finds himself haphazardly tossed upon the comfy black leather couch in his flat. On the coffee table in front of him are the two vials, one empty, the other still filled with the viscous, emerald liquid. He rubs his eyes and gets up from the couch, realizing he has not changed out of his clothes from last night. But that doesn't matter, he feels curiously clear-headed, for the first time in weeks. Helene's Agilian really is good, Harry muses. It should keep the pangs away for a week or two, at least.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"212\">First things first, however, Harry needs to hide the other phial of the drug. He can make wards later, for now, however, he needs a quick hiding place, which turns out to be a disillusionment charm and then chucking underneath the mattress of his bed. Once that niggling problem is dealt with, Harry hurries into the shower, brushes his teeth, and throws on fresh clothes, consisting of a slate blazer, a black button down shirt, a silver tie with stripes of black and a pair of dark jeans and loafers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"213\">He rushes downstairs, realizing he is running late, only to run nearly headfirst into his landlady, Jenny Hudson, a delightful middle-aged muggle woman whose husband is impotent (though they don't know that Harry knows that bit of information), and they treat Harry like the son they never had:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"214\">\"Hullo, Mrs. Hudson,\" he greets lightly, \"I'm running late. I'll see you tonight, yes?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"215\">The honey-haired woman smiles back, \"Oh, yes, of course, Harry. Will you be joining us for dinner?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"216\">\"I don't think I'll get home that early. I've got quite a lot to accomplish today.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"217\">\"Oh,\" Mrs. Hudson says, \"Well, don't hesitate to ring me for leftovers when you&nbsp;<em>do&nbsp;</em>get in.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"218\">\"Thanks, Mrs. Hudson,\" he replies, kissing her cheek as he would his mother if she were still alive.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"219\">\"Have a good day, dear!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"220\">Harry steps outside of the apartment building and moves away towards the bank of the River Avon. Jamming his hands into his pockets, he walks down the length of the River on the sidewalk, whistling the tune to 'The Farmer in the Dell' as he moves along. Soon, the River begins to shimmer as he comes to Bristol Bridge. Harry looks down from the bustling muggle city and looks down at the water for a moment, and back up, to find a large wizarding town open up in front of him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"221\">This is a more savory part of Wizarding Bristol than the area Harry had frequented last night. And it's a safe place to Apparate from. In a moment, once in a crowd of young wizards and witches, Harry concentrates on the familiar brick facade of his workplace and wills himself to go there. Soon, it feels like he's being squeezed through a garden hose, and with a soft, but audible pop, he lands in front of the Old Irish Metre, the Auror Headquarters situated on the outskirts of the Havering borough.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"222\">The building appears to be an amalgam of old and new. It was adapted in the way of most normal Wizarding buildings when first built in 1823, but new that the muggle Scotland Yard relocated and rebuilt their office building, Minister Shacklebolt had authorized a revamping of the Irish Metre so it could function as efficiently as the Muggle Police. Harry steps toward the large glass doors, where a coterie of unfriendly-looking guard Aurors await him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"223\">\"'Halt,\" comes a few voices all at once, and Harry raises his hand in acknowledgement before allowing himself to be checked by the guards. He is forced to present his wand as identification and take some form of Wizarding Biometrics test that Percy, Ron's older brother, had been yammering on about a few years back.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"224\">The guards relax after a few moments. \"'Ello, DCI,\" one mutters respectfully and Harry gives him a curt nod, passing through the doors.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"225\">The lobby is impeccably constructed, and, as one would expect, even bigger on the inside than it looks outside. Metallic floors stretch on outwards to a large and open lobby with leafy plants placed at all four corners of the room and around the crescent-shaped receptionist's desk. Dead center of the room are couple of couches along with reading materials, directly to the right is the cafeteria, and straight ahead at the end of the lobby are a row of glass elevators that gives a fantastic view of the London skyline. He passes by the couches and swipes a copy of the Daily Prophet from the coffee table, hoping to read Ginny's article on the state of Wizarding relations between the United States and Russia, and how it could tip the balance of power in Europe once more.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"226\">From there, it is a quick trip to the cafeteria to buy an English Muffin and then on to the elevators. Once inside, Harry takes a long, wistful glance at the London skyline, marveling at how brilliant muggles and wizards alike are.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"227\">The lift stops on Level 5, where the Serious Crimes Unit, or SCU, is located. Harry takes a bite of the muffin, walks to his cubicle, and collapses in his chair whilst searching for Ginny's Article. Of course, it is set below the top news of the day, a blaring title:&nbsp;<em>FIFTH MUGGLEBORN FOUND DEAD IN SAVERNAKE FOREST; AURORS HAVE SUSPECTS IN CUSTODY</em>. Harry ignores it, as it will be completely based off unwholesome information (Harry has imposed a media blackout on the SCU, and they certainly don't have a man in custody), and prefers to read Ginny's Editorial:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"228\"><em>The Iron Curtain<br /></em><em>By: Ginevra Molly Weasley</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"229\"><em>Since the fall of Lord Voldemort nearly five years ago, England has been forced out of its self-imposed political blackout and the U.K. finds itself in the centre of a brewing cold war between the Americans and the Russians, mirroring the situation the Muggle World was in no less than fifty-five years ago. A famous Muggle politician and son of a Squib, Sir Winston Churchill, described the sudden shutting down of communications between the Yanks and Soviets as an 'Iron Curtain' descending across the World, forever dividing the East and West. Today, we find ourselves locked in between these two powerhouses once more as we find ourselves staring down, not the likes of Josef Stalin or Leonid Brezhnev; Harry Truman or Gerald Ford, but rather the American Magical Secretary Daniel Halan and the Russian Premier Dmitri Abramov.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"230\"><em>With the failure to pass the AEL-TA (Americo-European League Tracking Association) Act last year, we have seen a souring of relations between the two most powerful wizarding countries.

Ron gives him a 'What did you do?' look, to which Harry shrugs and tosses Ginny's article aside, stalking to the open door where a giant of a man with graying hair that was once a dark brown stands.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"245\">\"Superintendent Granath,\" Harry greets.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"246\">\"DCI,\" Granath breathes out.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"247\">William Granath is in many ways, Harry's mentor. The moment the boy came out of Auror School, the man, a DCI like Harry is now at the time, was teaching him how to hold his own in a duel where one was outnumbered, and furthermore, something they did not teach at Training School: How to think like a spook.

Granath rolls his eyes:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"252\">\"Watch yourself, Potter. She may be all bubbly and helpful to you, but remember the circumstances under which you met her.

They have spent too much time looking at the old crime scenes, and nothing has changed. They still cannot find a damn thing.

And its no secret, what with one of my best friends being Hermione, where I stand on the issue of Muggle and Muggleborn treatment.

Granath will not be happy if he finds out Harry and Ron are speaking to their best friend about this, but what the Superintendent doesn't know won't hurt him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"313\">\"Okay,\" Ron nods, \"Let's go.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"314\">\"No you don't,\" Draco replies, holding the Weasley back by the scruff of his robes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"315\">Ron looks furious. \"What the&nbsp;<em>fuck</em>&nbsp;are you doing?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"316\">\"If Granath finds out we're gone, he's going to be doubly angry that you spent time that you should be using for work with your girlfriend,\" Harry rationalizes. \"I'll go see her. It won't take more than half-an-hour.\"</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"317\"><em>4:19 P.M.<br /></em><em>St. Mungo's Hospital, London, UK.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"318\">\"Well,\" Hermione starts, her golden-brown eyes narrowing, trying to remember, \"I don't think the letter itself is in any book I've read. Then again, I don't really remember every book I've read.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"319\">Harry's face falls. Practically every book (wizarding and muggle alike) he's read has been recommended to him by Hermione, so he thought if anyone would know, it would be her.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"320\">\"Then were the bloody hell do I remember this from?\" He questions to no one in particular, reclining on the couch of his friend's break room.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"321\">Hermione gives him an ironical smile, \"It's not from a book, Harry,\" she says. Harry sits straight, now confused, \"It's from a&nbsp;<em>letter</em>. Dear Boss.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"322\">\"Dear... Boss?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"323\">\"One of the first Jack the Ripper letters sent to the Scotland Yard,\" Hermione says, moving from a table to the sofa Harry already occupies, scooting in close to show him the copy of Aleister's letter, \"I remember reading about it, though not reading it directly, in one of my detective books from before Hogwarts. That postscript is taken word-for-word from that letter. And look at the first sentence. Does anything seem, I don't know,&nbsp;<em>off</em>&nbsp;about it to you?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"324\">Harry rereads the first line before his lips quirk into a smile. \"He calls us the police.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"325\">\"Exactly. Instead the Auror Corps, he calls you 'the police'. A muggle term. Doesn't that strike you a bit odd?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"326\">Harry smiles, completely shocked that he had missed such a giant clue. \"I didn't notice it at first,\" Harry replies, \"but now that you've pointed it out...\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"327\">And suddenly, his mind is racing in all sorts of different directions. Why Jack the Ripper; why a muggle? Could this really just be a sick sense of humor? Play Muggle games the Wizarding police to mock the fact that he's been slicing up little Muggleborn girls? And the foundry, could that be where he's hiding the girl? It's shoddy detective-work, Harry knows, as he hasn't got an ounce of hard evidence to back him up other than that the murder likely took place at an iron foundry nearby Bristol. And then there would be the problem of Helene. She's the only one who can get Harry into Fahranar, but it what would he do with her if they came face-to-face with the murderer. He couldn't bloody well have her stand around and fire curses while waiting for Granath and the rest of his unit. And-</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"328\">Harry's train of thought is suddenly broken by the laughter of the nearby brunette. \"What's so funny?\" He asks her.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"329\">\"No, no, it's nothing,\" Hermione replies, hand over her mouth to cover her soft giggles, \"Your face. You looked like you were about trying to blow something up with a glare.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"330\">\"Oh, uh, sorry,\" Harry apologizes without knowing why. \"Thanks for the info, anyway; you're a lifesaver, Hermione.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"331\">\"It's no trouble, Harry,\" the honey-haired healer says softly, \"I just want this Freya girl to be able to go to Hogwarts.\" Hermione trails off, looking downwards, no doubt at her shoes. \"It's horrible, what he does to these children.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"332\">\"Maybe it's better,\" Harry supplies quietly, at which Hermione's head whips upwards, her golden-brown eyes narrowed in fury:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"333\">\"How can it be&nbsp;<em>better</em>?\" She spits, likely offended that Harry even uttered such a thing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"334\">Harry raises his arms up in defense. \"Not that it happened in the first place,\" he explains his logic, \"But afterwards. All the other girls' parents were killed, any siblings met the same fate. And, children who have been through traumatic experiences like that tend to blame themselves for the death of their family members. With all that emotional damage, maybe it's a mercy when he finally kills them.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"335\">Hermione casts her gaze downwards again, biting her lower lip. \"I know, but... it's just... it's not right. It's horrifying.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"336\">Harry smirks in a wry manner. \"The world usually is.\"</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"337\"><em>5:10 P.M.<br />Office of the Irish Metre, London, UK</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"338\">\"DCI,\" a respectful voice from a young woman greets Harry at his desk with a large packet, \"we've gone over analysis of the letter given to us. It has not tested for any magical evidence that would allow us to ID the writer, but we found more of the strange dust on the parchment that was also present in Ms. Knightley's lungs yesterday.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"339\">Oh ho, Harry thinks sarcastically, the plot thickens!</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"340\">\"We were also able to trace the owl that came in with the letter.

Have to check on the girl's family.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"350\">\"Does that mean I have to put on Muggle clothes again?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"351\">\"Yes.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"352\">\"Damn.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"353\">-/-/-</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"354\"><em>5:25 P.M.<br /></em><em>One Halkin Street, Belgravia, City of Westminister, London, UK</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"355\">Harry awaits Ron, Draco, Neville, and Dalglish as they stand outside the door to a rather palatial brownstone that should belong to David and Anne Thompson, a wealthy businessman and doctor respectively. As with all new money, they've likely kept their noses out of other people's business, and have few friends living nearby to come check on them if they have been killed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"356\">Harry moves towards the door and raps on it with his knuckles two times. He quickly notes a doorbell to his side, and rings that as well after a polite waiting period.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"357\">No one answers the door.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"358\">He repeats the process twice. Still, no one answers. Harry looks at the four other men, and they all nod to each other, moving away from the house and into a nearby alleyway.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"359\">Harry taps his wand over his head when he sees the four men, looking rather awkward wearing Muggle plainclothes, and feels the wet-egg-running-down-his-head feeling of a Disillusionment charm. He watches as all his subordinates do the same and they all move back towards the house as chameleons, wands at the ready.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"360\">\"<em>Alohamora,</em>\" Harry whispers, pointing his wand at the doorknob, which clicks and opens in front of him, revealing a foyer characterized by hardwood floors and a warm orange creme glow from the paint on the walls. Nestled to the left are the stairs, and directly ahead down the hallway appears to be a large and spacious kitchen as well as a luxuriant dining room. But, rather than focus on that, Harry moves towards the drawing room, finding nothing but pictures of two brown-haired people and a girl who looks surprisingly like Hermione when she was that age planted onto the wall.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"361\">\"Hm... pretty family,\" Harry remarks, walking around the drawing room to a large entertainment room.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"362\">\"It's like they just up and left,\" Ron says, scratching his forehead.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"363\">Harry shakes his head, \"Girl was likely kidnapped last night. While they were sleeping.\" The other Aurors' eyes widen at the revelation and they all turn to make their way to the staircase.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"364\">They climb each stair slowly, careful not to make any noise.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"365\">When they reach the landing, they make sure to be careful about entering each of the six rooms. One turns out to be a bathroom, and another turns out to be a work office for David. A third reveals itself to be a veritable library for Dr. Thompson, with a great deal of anatomical textbooks shelved upon the many bookcases.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"366\">This goes on until they come across Freya's room, decorated sparsely with a placid white glow and pictures dotting the walls. They all appear to only be with her parents. Harry briefly wonders if this girl has any trouble making friends, but then immediately pushes that thought out of his head.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"367\">The things are strewn across the floor and the bed has been left unmade. \"Seems like a bloody hurricane came through here,\" Ron mutters.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"368\">Harry keeps quiet, moving out of that room to the master bedroom. He opens the door to find two lumps in the bed, completely undisturbed. Given that its five-thirty in the afternoon, Harry is pretty sure those bodies are not there by choice. He points to them so everyone has a clear view before moving into the large room. A small fireplace across the room from the bed burns with the embers of a fire from last night.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"369\">The Aurors spread around the large bed, flanking it as Harry slowly pulls off the covers. Two people, a man and a woman who look to be Mr and Mrs. Thompson, lay on the bed peacefully. Harry narrows his eyes, opening one of Mr. Thompson's eyes with his thumb. While looking in, he finds a brilliant green ring around the pupil which stands out against the brown of his eyes:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"370\">\"Grant,\" he calls. Grantley Dalglish has the most extensive curse experience, so Harry could use him to confirm his suspicions, \"Does that look like-\" he points to the ring of green that has suddenly materialized around the pupil of a man who has had brown eyes all his life.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"371\">\"Yep. Definitely the Killing Curse,\" Dalglish responds, folding his arms and furrowing his brows. \"The Avada Ring proves it.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"372\">\"I hadn't expected Bulstrom to be the type of person to allow the Ministry to tamper with his wand. I sure wouldn't.\" Draco says. Just after Voldemort's death, the Ministry had issued a countrywide call for refitting wands. As a result of this, if the&nbsp;<em>Avada Kedavra</em>&nbsp;is cast, the victim's eyes would develop a green ring around the pupil, known as the Avada Ring. Some wanted to go even further and place magical tracers in the event that an Unforgiveable Curse was used, but most people do not like the idea of being tracked.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"373\">Even Harry was a little miffed by the suggestion; it was too much to ask and, frankly, rankled Big Brother-totalitarianism to him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"374\">Harry shrugs at Draco's quip. \"Well, he likely didn't allow the tracer to be implanted. Otherwise, we would have gotten the call hours ago.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"375\">\"Must have been in a hurry to use the killing curse,\" Dalglish muses, \"The last family had been practically butchered. Maybe saw someone and ran for it?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"376\">\"Unlikely, or we'd have a third body, wouldn't we?\" Harry questions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"377\">\"Harry, mate,\" Ron calls from the front of the mirror of the Thompsons' expensive-looking dresser, \"you may want to take a look at this.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"378\">Harry stands and glides over to Ron. \"What is it?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"379\">Ron hands the DCI a note, written on parchment. All it reads is&nbsp;<em>HdB- B.F. 7</em>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"380\">\"What do you make of that?\" He asks as Harry nearly immediately decodes the message, \"it's not the handwriting we saw on Bulstrom's original letter.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"381\">\"And it doesn't appear to be either Mister or Dr. Thompson, nor does it appear to be their daughter. I've checked some of their notebooks.\" Neville's voice comes from behind Harry as the young man leans over Harry's shoulder to read the message.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"382\">Harry pauses for a moment, before giving a measured response. \"No. It isn't. Don't know whose it could be.\" It's a lie. He knows exactly whose this is, though how she could have gotten the information before he did is beyond him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"383\">There is the possibility that Helene, the&nbsp;<em>HdB</em>&nbsp;initialing on the missive, is the one behind the murders, but, truthfully, that's illogical. Helene may be a Pureblood, but she works with many Muggleborns, all of whom she appears to be on good terms with. For her to go on a sudden crusade against all things Muggleborn does not sit right with her actions. So, Harry glances over his second option: she wants to tell him something she has learned, and needs him at the Basilisk Fang at seven o'clock.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"384\">But, he's got to be careful. He might need a second.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"385\">\"Merlin, the bloody reports we'll have to file tonight!\" Ron grumbles</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"386\">The bloody reports indeed. Ron has always been Harry's six o'clock shadow, with the exception of fourth year and when he had left Harry and Hermione behind the year he fought Voldemort, and Harry could certainly use his red-haired best mate's help right about now.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"387\">When they finish with the crime scene and garner all the information they can, finding, without a doubt, traces of Aleister Bulstrom's magic all over the home, Harry calls Ron away from the group:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"388\">\"Ron, have you got anything to do tonight?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"389\">\"Well...\" Ron begins thoughtfully, \"Hermione and I are going to The Burrow to have dinner with the rest of the family; do you want to come?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"390\">\"Never mind that,\" Harry shake his head impatiently, \"you'll need to cancel.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"391\">Ron eyes Harry incredulously. \"But, Harry. It's my mum's cooking. And I've been looking forward to this for weeks. I don't get to see Bill, Charlie, George, or Percy very often.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"392\">\"I have a lead.

I'll do this, but only because you're my best mate. Making me miss me mum's food, though,&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;ought to be a capital offense.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"398\">Harry chuckles. \"Thanks.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"399\">\"Don't thank me,\" Ron says cheekily, \"I'm counting on you to explain this to my mother and Hermione.\"</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"400\"><em>6:58 P.M.<br />Basilisk Fang Tavern, Wizarding District, Bristol, UK</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"401\">\"This is, erm... a nice place,\" Ron remarks, scrunching his face, no doubt put off by the drug dealers and hookers outside, \"You come here often?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"402\">Harry catches his friend giving him a&nbsp;<em>look</em>. \"Not often, no.

Footsteps immediately clack on the ground, coming from somewhere behind the doorway with the bead curtain.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"405\">\"Harry?\" Helene's unmistakable voice calls out, \"I've got some exciting information for you-\" she steps out, wearing rather form-fitting battle robes, and does a double-take at the sight of Ron, \"-well, well, if it isn't the famous Ronald Weasley! Harry's told me quite a bit about you.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"406\">Ron turns to Harry, who shakes his head exasperatedly and says 'that's not true'.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"407\">\"Who is she?\" Ron asks, and Harry can tell the redhead is trying very hard not to gawp at the beautiful witch before them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"408\">\"Helene de Beauvoir,\" she says, stalking up to Ron and extending out a dainty hand to the man. \"Harry's information broker.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"409\">\"You two are... friends?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"410\">\"No,\" Harry says.

After the dubious circumstances under which we first met, do you really think Superintendent&nbsp;<em>Granath</em>-\" the auburn-haired witch spits out the name like a curse, \"-would take kindly to me calling in two murders and a kidnapping?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"416\">Harry remains silent, mulling over the woman's words.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"417\">\"So, Ron,\" she says, turning to the redhead, \"how&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;Harry at work?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"418\">\"Er... um, okay? I guess?\" Ron starts, obviously flustered. \"To be honest, I feel like he's disappointed with me all the time.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"419\">\"Really, does he do that thing to you as well?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"420\">Ron looks confused. \"Erm... what thing?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"421\">\"You know, he stares at you from the top of glasses like you've done something wrong, and gives you that look that says, even though he's&nbsp;<em>younger</em>&nbsp;than you-\" she pauses and smacks her jaws, as if getting ready to impersonate the raven-haired wizard: \"'I'm the father you never had, and I'm very disappointed in you'.\" Helene says conversationally, at which Ron guffaws and Harry shakes his head in exasperation.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"422\">\"Are we going, or what?\" Harry growls.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"423\">\"Careful now; I don't appreciate that tone very much,\" Helene chides.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"424\">\"Wait... where're we going?\" Ron asks.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"425\">The auburn-haired witch gives Harry a strange look, \"You didn't tell him why he came here?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"426\">\"Well... uh, sort of. Ron, we're going to an old Pureblood Iron Foundry about 25 kilometers Northwest of Bristol,\" Harry explains, \"If there's... erm...&nbsp;<em>trouble</em>&nbsp;there, I could use some backup.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"427\">\"Well the lady looks like she's ready to fight trolls,\" Ron says, huffing, \"I could be eating some of mum's steak-and-kidney pie!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"428\">Harry arches an eyebrow. \"Who? Helene? She's useless in a fight.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"429\">\"You bastard,\" Helene replies with an ironical smile.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"430\">\"Well, it's the truth. You're not even using your own wand, are you?\" Harry counters, remembering how it was conveniently stolen by the perpetrator of the murders of Helene's husband and children. Rumor had it, however, that she chucked it to keep from being suspected in said murders, \"And you're about as good at wandless magic as Hitler was at invading Russia.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"431\">\"Odd analogy, but I suppose it's fair,\" the auburn-haired metamorphmagus sighs, \"the actual practical application is a flaw, I admit, but, to be fair, it is my&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;flaw.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"432\">Harry makes a strangled, disbelieving noise, and Helene shoots him a frigid glare:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"433\">\"Besides, I have a replacement wand,\" she says, holding up her right wrist, revealing a wand holster, holding a wand made of some sort of light wood, \"it's nowhere near as good, but I can still hold my own in a fight.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"434\">\"Yeah, maybe against a first year,\" Harry scoffs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"435\">The information broker's eyes narrow, \"You would do well not to underestimate me, Harry. I'd never make it in this business of mine if I couldn't keep myself safe.\" She indicates another holster on her hip, no doubt containing one of Helene's much-lauded charmed handguns</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"436\">\"Well, I'm sure, but a blasted gun won't do you much good-\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"437\">\"-Hush, Harry, you think too much,\" she places a finger to his lips and beckons Ron come over, which the redhead reluctantly does. Helene moves her hands to grasp both of theirs, and with a deep breath, and that squeezed-through-a-tube that Harry has only gotten marginally more used to over the years, they disappear with a slight pop.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"438\"><em>7:15 P.M.<br />Fahranar, Portishead, UK</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"439\">\"Bloody hell,\" Ron mutters, rubbing his forehead in amazement, \"how does&nbsp;<em>no one</em>&nbsp;know about this place?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"440\">Harry agrees. In front of them, off the coast is a large and abandoned wizarding facility. And by all looks of it, it is a iron foundry meant to produce the metal&nbsp;<em>en masse</em>. Harry eyes the large, medieval building, with its flaring buttresses and gaunt and grim gargoyles wrapped in their wings at the tops. It is shaped like a castle, four towers, shaped in Staunton style accentuate the corners of the building like four enlarged chess pieces. It truly is a sight to behold.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"441\">\"Not many people know about it,\" Harry nearly misses Helene's explanation, \"It hasn't seen much use since the end of the War of the Roses, nearly 550 years ago. Besides, you wouldn't want the secret to get out. Apparently this was one of the few places they were able to make Eversteel, the steel that never breaks, out of iron forged here. You can see why the people who know about it would try to keep it a secret.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"442\">Ron sends the auburn-haired woman a questioning glance. \"Then how do you know about it?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"443\">\"Because I'm well-informed, unlike the rest of you lot,\" she remarks simply, moving along a dark, craggy path that leads to the beach. Ron shrugs at Harry and stalks off behind the eldest witch, leaving Harry behind to regret his twice-cursed life.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"444\">But, nevertheless, Harry follows.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"445\">The rocks around him are nearly coal black, and Harry briefly wonders about the seeming fetish that wizards had with overly-drab scenery, but he pushes the thought away and continues down onto a beach of white sand. He finds Ron following Helene to a rocky outcropping being pummeled by merciless waves, and rushes over to his friend:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"446\">\"Wands at the ready?\" Harry asks, smiling lightly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"447\">Ron does the same. \"Got your back, mate.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"448\">Helene disappears around a corner, calling back with a \"Watch your step boys, this ledge is a bit on the narrow side!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"449\">Harry and Ron climb up the outcropping and find themselves facing a ledge hanging close to a small cliff face, Harry jumps across the the gap between the outcropping and the ledge, plants himself against the wall, an action Ron repeats, and sidle there way to the corner the elder witch had passed through moments before. As they turn the corner, a long cracked piece of the ledge falls away just centimeters away from Ron's feet. He watches, in horror, as the loose, jagged bit of rock tumbles down the cliff face and into the violently swelling ocean. Ron's face turns green, which Harry makes comment upon:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"450\">\"You alright?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"451\">The redhead nods queasily. \"Yeah, yeah. Just... have I ever told you how much I&nbsp;<em>hate</em>&nbsp;heights?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"452\">\"No,\" Harry replies, grinning, \"You always seemed fine during Quidditch.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"453\">\"Well I think I'm developing a phobia.\" Harry lets out a barking laugh, turns, and due to his more svelt frame than Ron's, practically skips across the ledge whilst waving at the stomach-ached wizard to a landing where Helene awaits:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"454\">\"Where's the ginger knob?\" The witch asks.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"455\">\"Oi! I heard that!\" Comes a small voice over the loud, crashing waves. Both Harry and Helene chuckle. Ron finally makes it to the rocky landing and gives Harry a glare that asks why he's being made to do all this.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"456\">\"Oh, cheer up! Just like old times, yeah?\" Harry exclaims, clapping the redhead's back.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"457\">Ron continues to glare. \"Wanker.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"458\">\"No time for all this, then,\" Helene says, folding her arms, \"the longer we spend out here, the more time Mister Bulstrom has to torture the poor muggleborn!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"459\">Harry and Ron put an end to their banter at that, hurrying alongside the elder witch down landing, which stands down a long, pebble-strewn walkway, more doleful waves swelling up and splashing atop the stone pathway. The familiar feeling of a raw egg being cracked atop Harry's head runs over him, and he realizes Ron has put a disillusionment charm on him:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"460\">\"Thanks mate,\" Harry says; Ron nods, turning the charm on himself.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"461\">\"Watch your feet,\" Helene says distractedly, drying her own with a well-placed spell.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"462\">After what seems like ten minutes of walking, they come to a great stone door with iron-inlays, creating a strange relief welded into the face of the door. Helene walks up to the door, biding Harry and Ron stay behind whilst she puts an ivory hand to the center of the doorway. She mutters a few lines in what Harry thinks is Latin, but is too quick with her enunciation for a positive identification.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"463\">Once complete, the door glows a strange green color as a great clicking noise signifies the door ha been unlocked. Helene tentatively nudges the door open, careful to keep from making too much noise.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"464\">As expected, there is more stone inside, and a particularly pungent whiff of Sulfur Dioxide nearly sends Harry's head spinning. He steadies himself to walk into the giant fortress. Old cauldrons and blacksmith's anvils lay strewn across the floor, lost and forgotten to time. Broken, crumbling staircases lead to a dilapidated second floor, which had once, perhaps been another level for iron-casting, but most of the stone has fallen away down to the rubble that now lay haphazardly on the first floor, leaving a view of the large Romanesque ceiling, looking very much like the tiles below Harry's feet. The moonlight filters in through small holes in the wall, giving the entire foundry a very sanctified, holy look about it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"465\">\"Keep yourselves covered,\" Helene whispers, drawing her wand. Harry resists the urge to smirk, training his own wand at any shadow that may jump out at them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"466\">Their footsteps echo, so the trio take care to keep quiet and move slowly, so as not to make any noise. The hallway does not stretch on for long, but trying to keep quiet whilst climbing over all the rubble is a long and arduous task. Coming to the end of the dark hallway, Ron whispers:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"467\">\"How long has this place been abandoned, you say?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"468\">Helene sniffs and blinks rather disdainfully, as if she has finally gotten a whiff of the chemicals in the air. \"Nearly 550 years.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"469\">\"Bloody hell,\" Ron remarks, looking at the ancient walls.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"470\">Helene moves towards the end of the hallway, where another grand door awaits opening. Helene utters another quick Latin chant and the door opens in front of her. They walk into a large antechamber which appears to be where all the iron was made. Some overlarge constructs for iron-making that Harry doesn't recognize dot the chamber, and several torches light large stone columns that seem to jut upwards towards infinity. Harry looks up overhead to see stars and the night sky winking back down at him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"471\">He moves to a column, only to hear Ron's rushed, insistent voice:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"472\">\"Harry, there!\" He whispers, just loud enough for the raven-haired wizard to hear him, \"Freya, that's her!\" Ron points to the wall on the opposite side of the gargantuan chamber. Harry turns, and sure enough, there is the girl, badly bruised, chained with both wrists to a column and seemingly unconscious. Or possibly dead.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"473\">\"Go around the columns,\" he whispers to his two companions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"474\">Both Ron and Helene nod, moving forward around the columns. It takes no more than thirty seconds to get to the other side of the room, and when they do, Harry immediately checks the little girl's pulse. It's faint, but there.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"475\">Harry breathes a sigh of relief. \"Alive.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"476\">\"Oh, good,\" Ron grins, \"Looks like Bulstrom must be out.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"477\">\"Must be,\" Harry agrees.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"478\">Ron stops and stares at the sleeping brown-haired girl, \"You know, she kind of looks like Hermione did at her age.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"479\">Harry turns to him, \"Ron, mate. That's gross.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"480\">Ron's eyes blink uncomprehendingly, until he realizes that he's comparing an eleven year-old to the woman he's dating. \"Oh, er,\" he splutters, \"I... I, uh, I didn't mean it like that!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"481\">Harry says nothing, only telling Helene that she should Apparate the girl out of the Foundry while Ron and Harry would await Aleister Bulstrom, but Helene vehemently disagrees with that course of action, saying that Harry and Ron wouldn't know the way out without a Pureblood who knew the incantations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"482\">But just as Harry is about to make a second plan of action, Freya shifts slightly, opening her eyes blearily, before muttering, rather pathetically: \"Ow.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"483\">\"Freya?\" Harry asks, \"Freya Thompson?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"484\">She blinks at Harry, perhaps too tired to defend herself. \"Wha-what are you going to do to me?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"485\">Harry shakes his head. \"My name's Harry. I'm here to help you get out of here. These two are Helene-\" Helene waves in a manner far too cheery for the situation, \"-and this is my best mate, Ron.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"486\">\"Harry? Ron?\" Freya blinks, \"Not Harry Potter and Ron Weasley?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"487\">\"Boy, when did I get so famous?\" Ron grumbles.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"488\">\"The very same,\" Harry nods. He is about to say something when a loud clicking noise emerges from the back of the antechamber.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"489\">\"Bollocks,\" Ron mutters, \"he's here.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"490\">\"Help me out,\" Harry says quickly, standing. Ron immediately knows what Harry intends to do and aims his wand at the chains shackling one wrist, while Harry trains his wand on the other.\"Close your eyes,\" Harry whispers soothingly to the terrified preteen.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"491\">\"<em>Reducto</em>!\" Both Harry and Ron say simultaneously, blasting the manacles off the girl.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"492\">Knowing that Bulstrom must have heard that, and judging by the sudden rush of a lone pair of footsteps coming their way, Harry gingerly grabs Freya, and carries the girl to relative safety, where he sets her down in the dark. Before he leaves, however, Harry turns to Ron and simply mutters \"Beijing String\".</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"493\">\"Stay here,\" Harry says to the girl, setting her down.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"494\">A large man, with a big gait and big muscles stands in the center of the antechamber. \"I know you're here!\" He calls, running a hand through his stringy blonde hair. \"Come out!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"495\">Harry grins, the plan will work. Ron will lead Helene over to where Freya sits, grab the girl and get out of the Foundry, while Harry takes on Bulstrom. It can't be hard can it, after all, Harry&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;best Voldemort in a duel. He steps out of the shadows provided by the large columns. Bulstrom whirls to meet him, and his lips quirk upwards into a rather ugly smile. Fortunately, he can hear the light, scampering footsteps of Ron and Helene as they pick up the muggleborn and hurry away. Aleister's eyes flick towards the shadows, and his smile, if anything, grows wider:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"496\">\"<em>Avada Kedavra</em>!\" Is the first spell out of the wizard's mouth and Harry involuntarily tenses. A jet of green light shoots out at Ron, Freya, and Helene; the first of which, wide-eyed, slams shut the door to the antechamber before the curse can reach the trio, and it bounces harmlessly off the large stone-and-iron door.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"497\">\"Boss Potter,\" he whistles, turning to Harry, \"to be completely honest, I hadn't expected you to come already. But I don't really care about the girl, do what you want with her.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"498\">\"Well, I don't like to keep people waiting,\" Harry replies, shrugging.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"499\">\"Then I shall do you the same courtesy,\" Bulstrom says, his wand appearing in his hands, seemingly out of thin air, \"<em>Diffindo!\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"500\"><em>\"Protego,\"</em>&nbsp;Harry says, watching the curse bounce harmlessly off his shield. He casts two disarming spells in the killer's direction, who jumps out of the way rather spryly. The bright red curse collides into the wall and splatters into nothingness.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"501\">An acid yellow curse of unknown intention flies towards Harry, and thinking it is best to avoid the curse entirely, Harry jumps out of the way, yelling \"<em>Confringo</em>!\" A jet flame captures the hem of Bulstrom's robes, who docks into the relative safety of the shadows. Harry cannot let Bulstrom stay in the shadows, unseen to the emerald-eyed wizard, so he mutters \"<em>Acervus</em>\" and watches as the man blindly bumps his way out of the shadows, his robe still steaming.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"502\">Harry is about to fire a stunner when Bulstrom utters the countercurse and aims his wand at Harry, who, in a fit of brilliance that his godfather would no doubt be proud of, screams out \"<em>Levicorpus</em>\", causing the dumbfounded man to drop his wand and turn head over heels until he is hanging suspended, upside down. Before Harry can do anything, however, the man&nbsp;<em>accio</em>s his wand back into his hands and sends another off-balance Severing Charm, which grazes Harry's shoulder.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"503\">The sudden pain causes Harry to break concentration with his own spell and Bulstrom goes tumbling to the ground in a heap of limbs. However, he reacts quicker than Harry, getting up and sending four hexes Harry's way that he just barely has time to pull up a shield against them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"504\">Two quick half-casted Reductor curses, lower in power, but quicker than the fully-powered spells fly towards Bulstrom, who dodges out of the way, causing the spell to break up nothing more than the stone floor. The stringy blond-haired man disappears into the shadows of the surrounding pillars, leaving Harry wary of all directions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"505\">Harry brings up a Protego shield and silently curses his luck, as this place negates his time-perfected fighting skill of flash apparitions, which consisted of quick teleportations and leaving double images to confuse the enemy as he appeared to strike from nine different angles.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"506\">But he is not without his own tricks, casting a hearing enhancement spell over himself. Instantly, all sorts of sounds became audible in the gloaming and the already dark antechamber. He can hear the rain pelting the roof above, the waves crashing against the rocks in the distance, and, most importantly, every sound in the room.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"507\">A shift to his right, too light for human footsteps. Likely a rat.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"508\">\"You shouldn't move,\" he taunts, smiling. It's been too long since he has had a good duel!</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"509\">He has figured Bulstrom out, Harry thinks. A malignant sociopath, a practical black hole, consuming without remorse and with reckless abandon. Harry almost smiles. People such as him are characterized by a few things, a need to collect souvenirs from their victims, and the inability to stay calm once taunted.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"510\">And Bulstrom, Harry&nbsp;<em>knows</em>, will eventually make his mistake.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"511\">\"Go ahead, Aleister,\" Harry mocks, \"I've got cells to burn.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"512\">A sudden shift and a strange pink spell flies at Harry, who simply raises his Protego to block it and sends back a powerful blasting curse that leaves a dent in the stone of one of the pillars.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"513\">\"You'll destroy this place with all those spells, you know?\" Bulstrom questions from all directions. Harry grits his teeth; the killer had charmed his voice to surround Harry's hearing, rendering him unable to discern the man's position.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"514\">He'll have to take the offensive, then.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"515\">Harry himself darts into the relative safety of the shadows of the pillars, dodging a few hexes on the way there, and quickly disillusions himself and casts a silencing charm upon his feet. If he wouldn't be able to play double-image tricks on Bulstrom, he'd simply become&nbsp;<em>invisible</em>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"516\">So he sneaks around in the dark, eyes slowly becoming accustomed to the inky blackness surrounding himself, and somewhere in the large antechamber, Bulstrom. For a long time, Harry feels as if he is getting nowhere, and the silence is unnerving. And then, quite suddenly, he finds himself face-to-face with the dark wizard by bumping into him. Harry curses his inattentiveness as Bulstrom takes a wild swing at him. It is far too close-quarters for wand combat, so Harry sticks muggle fighting methods he had learned as part of the Auror training course, using his fists and feet rather than his magic.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"517\">Fortunately, Harry has the upper-hand, having been disillusioned, and lands a rather satisfying haymaker on Bulstrom's chin, sending him backwards. Harry does not stop there, however, and rushes up to the backpedaling wizard and tackles him to the ground, trying to reach for his wand while the bigger man tries to shrug Harry off, eventually doing so by throwing Harry off.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"518\">Harry lands on the ground with a painful thud, his back making a sickening crack on the ground, but he quickly recovers, standing up alongside Bulstrom. His disillusionment charm has faded, and both men stare each other down.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"519\">There is a sudden flash of color as both men move. Reds, yellows, blues and purples fly in a rainbow of destructive power, both Harry and Bulstrom half-casting to gain the upper hand.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"520\">The killer silently lifts a boulder and tosses it Harry's way, until the DCI banishes it behind Bulstrom, who is tripped by the large stone, landing painfully on his back. With a sense of spryness that should not be possible from a man of Bulstrom's stature, he sends a stinging hex towards Harry that catches the DCI unawares and slows Harry down for just a second.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"521\">Rather than cut his losses, Bulstrom rushes Harry, sending wild punches at the Auror's face, who backed up into a wall, blocks with a rope-a-dope styled defense. When Bulstrom tries one last punch, Harry makes his move, grabbing the man's wrist, manually disarming him, and flipping him over. Bulstrom lands on the ground with a loud 'thump' and groans, before kicking his legs up, catching Harry in the chin, causing the DCI to stumble backwards. The killer's hand-to-hand combat was lacking, indeed, but he was still a wizard, Harry knew, and could rely on magic when all else failed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"522\">Bulstrom rushed Harry again, only to be met with a foot to the chest as he fell backwards, using the small time window to send another stinging hex at Harry. He is up almost as immediately as he had fell, and the next thing Harry sees is a jet of green light whizzing towards him. It takes all his fleibility and more than a little luck to dive out of the way and into the relative safety of the pillars. Harry stays down in the shadows, but almost immediately hears scuffling that sounds like a man running.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"523\">Bulstrom scampers past Harry to the doorway, grinning. \"Be a little slow, just once, Potter,\" he cries jubilantly, uttering something in Latin as Harry gives chase. He is only able to slip through the door before it would shut and lock the Halfblood inside.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"524\">Once outside the antechamber, Harry finds four playful jinxes sent his way that he deals with easily. Climbing up the rubble, however, not so. A volley of curses and charms fly around the long hallways, and before long, they're at the second door. Harry instinctively knows what the wizard is planning to do and wills his legs to catch up to the man as they burst through the doorway and out onto the wet walkway leading back to Portishead.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"525\">Bulstrom already appears to be getting ready for Apparition, so with one last lunge, and a look around to make sure Ron, Helene, and Freya are gone, Harry grabs a hold of Aleister, who gives him a look of utter shock as the familiar feeling of being squeezed through a tube much to small for Harry envelops him and the enemies disappear into the night with a soft, but audible pop, off to places unknown.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"526\"><strong>A/N</strong>: Helene will not take Hermione's place as the third member of the trio, if you're wondering.

And that he will often be in life-threatening situations; that does not frighten him. In fact, it lifts his spirits. Apparition is thought untraceable, and Harry's last known location must be miles away from where he stands now, on a beach, wand trained at Bulstrom. But, rather than fear, this brings excitement. Harry is alone, utterly alone. Backup can't come because Ron doesn't know where he's gone. But the chase is over nearly as quickly as it begun.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"7\">Harry was simply faster, regaining his bearings quicker than Bulstrom and using a quick&nbsp;<em>Expelliarmus</em>&nbsp;to relieve him of his wand.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"8\">The other man, sitting in the sand, looks over the mournful waves crashing against the shore. \"This is a pretty place.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"9\">Harry snorts, not expecting the man to have any conception of beauty. \"Yeah, it is,\" he finally says, after a long period of hesitation. He looks up at the gray sky, rapidly turning to the inky black it will be in a few hours.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"10\">\"You shouldn't have followed me.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"11\">\"Probably not, but I did. And, so, here we are,\" Harry replies, pointing from Bulstrom to himself.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"12\">But the elder man shakes his head, stringy blond hair swinging left and right with the movement. Harry admits, he must look confused, and Bulstrom notices. The dirty man's lips curve upwards into a farce of a smile:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"13\">\"Liverpool is not a place for someone like you. Not anymore, at least.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"14\">So that's where they are? Liverpool. Since when did Liverpool become dangerous for him? Harry knows it's a haunt for retired MI6 agents, but not Dark Wizards. They usually stick to larger cities, so as to make it easier to blend in with the population. And, being someone perpetually preoccupied with intelligence, Harry quirks an eyebrow in interest:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"15\">\"And why would that be?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"16\">That smile never leaves Bulstrom's face as he speaks. \"And why would I tell some Mudblood-loving cunt like you?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"17\">\"Because,\" Harry smirks, raising his wand \"<em>Petrificus totalis</em>\" the dark wizard's body seizes up and locks together, allowing Harry to grab him by the scruff of his robes and drag him to the waters. Harry curses not having any anti-magic manacles on him, as Ron was supposed to do the arrest, but this will have to do for now.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"18\">He sets Bulstrom on his knees just in front of the shoreline, and kicks the man in the back so he falls over into the frigid ocean waters. Harry lets the man struggle in the water for a moment before letting him up and reapplying the charm.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"19\">\"If you don't tell me,\" Harry says with a ghost of a smile, \"I can just let you drown.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"20\">\"You know, I could easily break this juvenile charm,\" Bulstrom growls, \"but, think about it, the great Harry Potter torturing a suspect who hasn't even gotten a trial! How the mighty have fallen!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"21\">Harry nods. \"But I think they'll be fine with it when they find out you've been butchering little Muggleborn girls.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"22\">\"Not everyone. Not this city.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"23\">\"Well I suppose it's a good thing they don't know we've arrived yet,\" Harry replies lightly, kicking the wizard into the water again.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"24\"><em>8:06 PM</em><br /><em>St. Mungo's Hosptial, London, UK</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"25\">\"We've got to get the girl to a room quickly,\" Helene says, rather frantic for a normally imperturbable woman. \"She's clearly been drugged. And some of these wounds we look bad.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"26\">Ron grunts. \"I'm moving as fast as I can!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"27\">The two burst into the Emergency Sector of St. Mungo's Hospital, where two Healers look from the two redheads and the brunette child who has obviously been through a trying eighteen hours, before rushing towards the two.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"28\">\"Name?\" One of them asks.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"29\">\"Freya Thompson, a student going to Hogwarts this year,\" Ron immediately replies, \"Multiple knife wounds, possible sexual abuse. Page Healer Granger, as well.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"30\">The girl is levitated onto a stretcher and carried away by the healers while Helene takes a seat.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"31\">\"I have to go get Harry some backup,\" Ron says to Helene, \"Can you tell Healer Granger, she's the brown-haired one, that I need to talk to her about Harry?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"32\">Helene looks appalled. \"I can't stay here and talk to some person I don't know; I have to get back to my shop!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"33\">\"It will only be a few minutes,\" Ron tries to placate the woman, rushing out the door before Helene can say no. The aging witch sits down and sighs until she hears a soft voice above her:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"34\">\"Are you the mother?\" She asks. Helene looks up to see a pretty honey-haired witch looking back down at her, and for a moment she wonders why Harry was so attracted to The Ginger when Healer Granger was around. Even as a woman, Helene can tell the woman in front of her is quite attractive, even more so, in her humble opinion, than the 'stunning' (as the Daily Prophet put it) Ginny Weasley.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"35\">\"Uh, no, no,\" Helene shakes her head, \"I'm an...\" she pauses and waves her wand, reciting \"<em>Muffliato</em>\" and turns back to the woman, \"... I'm an informant of Harry Potter's. Ronald Weasley, he, and I found that little girl Freya Thompson at an abandoned Iron Foundry near Portishead.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"36\">Suddenly, Hlr. Granger's eyes lace with worry. \"Freya Thompson? Are they alright? Harry? Ron?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"37\">\"Ron is fine, he's just left for the OIM. He says that he'll be back with Harry.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"38\">\"And Harry? Is Harry with him?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"39\">\"No,\" Helene breathes, \"He's very likely at the Foundry with the killer.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"40\">\"You left him there?\" The Muggleborn breathes furiously.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"41\">Helene, for some reason, feels compelled to defend herself. \"Well, it wasn't if I had the choice! I was only there because I knew how to get them in. Everything else was Harry and Ron's doing. Seemed more like Harry wanted Ron out of the way, if you'd ask me.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"42\">\"That stupid man!\" Hlr. Granger exclaims, eyes shining with worry, taking a seat next to Helene. \"Sometimes I wonder...\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"43\">Helene quirks an eyebrow. \"Wonder what?\" She asks when it becomes apparent that the Healer will not finish. Hlr. Granger does not say anything, perhaps because she does not trust Helene enough, and continues to stare unblinkingly at the wall, as if in deep thought.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"44\">The door bursts open, and Ron rushes through, making a beeline for Helene and Hlr. Granger. \"Hermione!\" He calls out, moving towards the brunette and kissing her cheek. Hermione shies away, telling him not to do that while they're at her workplace. The two talk of something that Helene doesn't pay much attention to before Ron turns to the auburn-haired witch, \"We need you to help us get into Fahranar again.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"45\">It is only then that Helene realizes the predicament she has gotten herself into.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"46\"><em>8:15 PM</em><br /><em>Fahranar, Portishead, UK</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"47\">\"That bloody idiot,\" Granath mutters to himself, \"we've got Muggleborns disappearing and now the bloody Boy-Who-Lived is gone, too?\" Ron, chastised, can only nod. \"And Helene de Beauvoir? I thought I told Harry to be&nbsp;<em>careful</em>&nbsp;around her, and now he goes running off with her to capture child-killers?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"48\">\"With all due respect, sir-\" Ron begins, watching Helene, who sits on a fallen boulder rather glumly, but Granath cuts him off:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"49\">\"I don't need explanations. I need to find out where Potter ended up. Put out an alert. Maybe someone, somewhere will stumble across them.\" A wave rises up and crashes against a jagged rock, spraying Ron and the Superintendent lightly and the Weasley turns away immediately afterwards, apparating into the night.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"50\">Granath turns back to the foundry, stroking his beard thoughtfully.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"51\"><em>8:20 PM</em><br /><em>Liverpool, UK</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"52\">\"So, are you ready to talk, yet?\" Harry asks. Bulstrom spits some of the seawater at him in response.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"53\">Harry sighs, wiping the water off his arms, \"Thank you,\" he drawls, \"I guess we'll have to go back to the OIM, then.\" He takes hold of the arm of a suddenly grinning Bulstrom and tries to Apparate, only to feel something blocking him from leaving.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"54\">\"Anti-apparition wards?\" Harry muses, \"Over a beach?\" Something obviously isn't right. His fears are realized when he detects two magical signatures fast approaching behind him. Quick as a whip, Harry whirls around and fires a Stunner at the two signatures approaching.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"55\">One of them falls down quicker than a log. Harry notes the one he hit was a none-too-small man who now lay face-down in the sand. A woman, perhaps his partner, completely ignores her fallen comrade as she stalks over to Harry. She is a rather plain-faced woman, but the sneer on her lips, the raven-black hair, and the violent fire in her dark brown eyes make this woman look like a Succubi. She wears strange robes, consisting of a white regimental coat (like the ones that Muggles war during the American Revolutionary War, Harry mentally adds) with a hood affixed, though she does not wear it, some sort of a button-down shirt underneath, heavily reinforced trousers and boots. She looks very much like a soldier, Harry thinks. Her sneer, once she sees Harry, morphs into a gorgeous smile:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"56\">\"Wotcher, Auror Potter,\" she greets simply, holding up her wand at Harry. \"I'm going to have to ask you to step away from Aleister over there.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"57\">\"And if I choose not to?\" Harry questions, his wand trained on her as well.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"58\">The woman's grin, if anything, grows wider: \"I'd kill you,\" She says, \"but I don't want to kill you. It would be unfortunate, considering we're on the same side.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"59\">\"Are we, now?\" Harry asks.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"60\">\"If by on the same side, we both want to kill that greasy-haired wanker behind you, then yes, we're on the same side.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"61\">Harry shrugs. \"Well, that's rather unfortunate, because I'm not planning on killing him today.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"62\">\"Still,\" the unidentified witch says, \"You solve your problem if you give him to me. You can then go back home, get some sleep, and come in tomorrow telling them you failed to capture Bulstrom, but then find that someone else did through the Daily Prophet.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"63\">\"Or,\" Harry stops, stroking his chin thoughtfully, \"I can hex you to oblivion and get out of here.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"64\">\"As long as you're in Liverpool, you're not getting reprieve. And we'll never let you get out of the city.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"65\">\"We?\" Harry questions sarcastically.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"66\">\"Never you mind,\" the witch replies, \"now hand the man over.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"67\">Harry turns to look at Bulstrom, whose features have morphed into something along the lines of fear. \"I'd take Petre over them any day,\" he says fearfully, apparently hoping to appeal to Harry's sense of mercy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"68\">\"As much as knowing how he feels makes me want to hand him over, I'm still going to have to say no,\" Harry shrugs, turning back to the woman. She grimaces in response:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"69\">\"And is there a reason why you're being so stubborn, Harry Potter?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"70\">Harry looks up, as if trying to remember something. \"No, not really. I just think that since I caught him, I get to turn him in.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"71\">\"So, this is for what, your ego?\" The witch asks disbelievingly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"72\">\"I'm&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;egotistical,\" Harry responds, nodding vigorously.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"73\">The woman shakes her head. \"Well, then, I guess I'll have to kill you.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"74\">\"By your leave,\" Harry replies lightly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"75\">\"<em>Confringo!</em>\" She yells, as a blast of fire comes Harry's way. In a fit of quick thinking, and remembering Dumbledore's fight with Voldemort at the Ministry during Harry's fifth year, he manipulates some of the seawater into a veritable shield of water around Bulstrom and himself. When through with that, he uses a levitating spell on one of the jagged rocks at the end of the beach, sending it flying at the attacking witch.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"76\">Her eyes widen to see a large boulder flung at her from behind the wall of water, and she is barely able to use a blasting spell to keep herself from being skewered.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"77\">Come on, Harry, the young man thinks, make deductions! Why is there a woman here wanting a serial killer, what could she possibly need. Stall her. Stall her.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"78\">\"Interesting,\" Harry starts, surveying the woman's face, \"<em>Confringo&nbsp;</em>is not a particularly lethal spell. Why would you use it if you intend to kill?\" No fine jewelry, and the robes she wears are practically tatters. This is not a very rich witch, Harry assumes, nor a particularly feminine one, given the way she binds herself and styles her hair in a sloppy ponytail.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"79\">\"Why do you care?\" She spits.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"80\">Easy to anger, too. Despite that she seemed to have kept her calm prior to the first spell, but it appears a fight brings out the worst in her. Furthermore, she's reckless. Her stunned partner is still laying in the ground, and she's taking an Auror one-on-one.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"81\">\"No reason,\" Harry replies, eyes trailing down to her left hand. Married, but the husband is either dead or divorced, due to the band-shaped discoloration on her left ring finger. \"Excuse me,\" He turns his wand and sends a stunner at Bulstrom as well, so he doesn't make an attempt to escape, \"Where were we, now?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"82\">\"Here!&nbsp;<em>Waddiwasi</em>!\" The blasted rocks rise and launch themselves at Harry, who brings up a shield charm.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"83\">Harry does not need to waste time with this woman, other than to find out who she is working for. Of course, he could always just&nbsp;<em>Rennervate</em>&nbsp;his violent companion and find out just exactly who it is that wants him dead. And why. Using more elemental manipulation, Harry is able to kick up a sandstorm, temporarily blinding the woman as he grabs the unconscious man and starts running.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"84\">He is not entirely sure where he is going, and a Four-Point Spell wouldn't do him any wonders, so Harry runs. Gifted with having at least eight inches in height on the woman, he is easily able to outrun her, but she is also more agile, and the idiot of a man Harry has to carry does the Wizard-Who-Won no favors.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"85\">A streak of purple light passes by him, nearly connecting with Bulstrom on his shoulder, but Harry is able to duck out of the way at the last second and send a Bone-Breaking Jinx at the pursuer, who grimaces as the jinx strikes her arm and snaps her ulna on the spot.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"86\">He continues to run, jumping over stones and avoiding obstacles, and once even running straight through dry wall at a construction site. Bounding into the complex of Iron and steel, Harry sets numerous traps including the length of the copper wiring, and freezing the wet parts of the floor, no doubt from a water leak above.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"87\">\"<em>Serikos</em>!\" he mutters at a doorway he passes, encasing the hole in between with invisible spider's silk, meant to keep her from proceeding any further. In a breakneck run, he passes through a construction project, closed for the night, and breaks out the other end into Liverpudlian traffic. A quick dsillusionment charm on both Harry and Bulstrom makes them look like two walking men to everyone else.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"88\">He checks behind him to see if the woman comes out, which she does, bursting out the same door he did, covered in what looks like spider webs, into the nighttime traffic and gets trapped in a crowd of pedestrians. She looks around for a moment, stamps her foot, and turns back to the construction site as Harry breathes easy. He gets up and holds Bulstrom once more, looking for a secluded and abandoned place to stay for the night.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"89\">Harry doesn't know how far he walks, and every time he tries to Apparate, he ends up on his arse. So, the raven-haired wizard gets up and moves on, crossing mile after mile until the city center is gone and he finds himself staring down an old barn that appears to have been in disuse for the last twenty years. He drags Bulstrom inside after making sure no one lives nearby and lays the man down on a mat of straw.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"90\">An idea pops into his head. If he can't get out of Liverpool, there might be a way to get others to help him out. He pulls out his mobile phone, hoping for a signal, but curses himself as he finds none. He'll have to go further away from the secluded barn in the pine forest to be able to make a call to Hermione, the only friend he has that uses a mobile.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"91\">But, for now, he'd best question Bulstrom while no one is looking for them</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"92\">\"<em>Rennervate</em>,\" he says, but quickly adds an&nbsp;<em>Incarcerous</em>&nbsp;so Bulstrom wakes wrapped and bound in ropes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"93\">\"Is this necessary?\" He asks angrily.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"94\">Harry smiles lightly, \"Quite necessary, I assure you. Now, who was that woman and why was she after you?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"95\">Bulstrom settles down for a moment, \"I don't think you want to know.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"96\">Harry trains his wand on Bulstrom in response. \"I think I do.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"97\">\"The fact that I know whom they are is why they want to kill me.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"98\">\"Ooh, scary,\" Harry drawls, \"the woman they sent after us was rather pitiful.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"99\">\"Don't underestimate her, Potter,\" Bulstrom begins, \"that woman could kill you in a second if she really wanted to. She's just trying to get you out of the way to get me.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"100\">\"And why does she want you?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"101\">\"Because I seek to destroy,\" the elder man replies cryptically.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"102\">\"Stop with the riddles, just tell me.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"103\">He looks over, quite seriously. \"I don't particularly care for you, so I guess it won't harm to tell you. She is part of The Circus.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"104\">\"The Circus?\" Harry's eyes narrow, \"You're speaking nonsense again.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"105\">\"Let's just say they're no friends of the Aurors,\" Bulstrom drawls.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"106\">\"But they want to kill you. Why?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"107\">Bulstrom smirks. \"Because,\" he says, \"I am no friend of theirs. My cause is not theirs.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"108\">\"Your cause,\" there is a hard-edged insistence to Harry's voice that causes even the seasoned serial murderer to recoil:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"109\">\"Well, certainly. I have a cause. I'm not so petty as to do things just because I&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;to. And I certainly don't serve myself. How terribly misguided that would be!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"110\">\"Like what?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"111\">\"A higher order of justice.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"112\">\"Murdering Muggleborns?\" Harry snorts, disbelieving. Bulstrom shoots Harry a glare:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"113\">\"Shut up. There are many reasons as to why I did what I did, and for the sheer enjoyment of it is definitely one of the lowest rungs on that ladder.\" He pauses. \"Well, I'm in a shite position: prison with you or death with Stella-\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"114\">\"Stella?\" Harry asks, \"That's her name?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"115\">\"Yes, a mid-ranker in The Circus. Dunno what she does or why, but she's been after me for years.\" Bulstrom starts, \"Stella Gerrard. Crazy bint, that one. But, as I was saying, I'm not the greatest position right now, it seems, so I suppose it can't hurt to tell you. You have quite an admirer, Harry James Potter.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"116\">\"Well, I'm flattered,\" Harry says coquettishly, before returning to a more serious demeanor, \"Can you tell me who the Cyrano is that I may thank them for their interest?\" Bulstrom breaks out into light chuckles, a raspy, half-dead sound:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"117\">\"Unfortunately, I'm bound not to tell you. Your admirer is a very secretive person. And even if you did know the name, I don't think you'd like to meet this person. After all, five children are dead and a sixth is recovering because of said person's actions.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"118\">\"Said person's? So, you're&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to blame for all of this. It was actually someone who forced you to do it.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"119\">\"No, no, no, I gladly did it!\" Bulstrom admits, grinning wildly, \"But the purpose and manner in which it happened are far different than you think.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"120\">Harry waits for him to continue, but when it appears that the Dark Wizard will not go on, Harry punches him in the stomach. \"No, no, don't stop on my account!\" He says sardonically, loosening Bulstrom's tongue once more.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"121\">\"Ouch,\" he mutters, which would have been alright in Harry's mind if the man wasn't cackling the way he is. After a few moments, however, he regains his ability to speak: \"Have you ever played chess, Harry?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"122\">\"Quite a few times,\" Harry replies, \"was never much good at it up until a few years ago.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"123\">\"Ah, good, then. Because I'll explain it to you in the easiest, most clich&eacute;d way possibly. You should take a page from the game. There are all these people around you, aren't there? All those Ministry Officials and your friends and your partner... et cetera. All of you are pieces, being moved back and forth on a chessboard. And you're playing this game, believe me. You don't know it, but you're playing. You and I? Right now, we're just pawns.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"124\">Playing Devil's Advocate to an obviously childish analogy, Harry responds: \"But pawns can become queens.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"125\">\"And how many do? You just sacrifice them. Their friends, families, reputations,&nbsp;<em>lives</em>... you can even knock down and rebuild their belief system until everyone looks the same. Small little pawn pieces. That's what they call order. The Ministry, Hogwarts, every little establishment of the wizarding world wants to make you a pawn.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"126\">\"Your point?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"127\">\"Higher justice. I want to show the world that you can step up and defy the great Ministry, that you don't have to be a pawn-\" he pauses, looking up reverently. Harry has to keep himself from groaning, realizing that he is stuck with an obviously crazy person until he can get out of Liverpool.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"128\">\"Your pro-muggle and pro-muggleborn legislation-\" Bulstrom spits, \"-all garbage. And me? An anti-Muggle sadist? No, there are far better reasons to kill someone than their magical background.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"129\">\"And that is?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"130\">\"Make the population&nbsp;<em>fear</em>.\" Bulstrom's grin turns devious, \"if you teach someone to fear, you are the father of knowledge. Every single bit of learning comes through fear. All meaning comes from fear. A happy population is a nation of sheep. If tragedies happen every now and then, if people do not forget the myths that made them dread bedtime as children, the population knows to learn. For its own survival. And your peace-loving edicts on how one can or can't treat a child makes the entire country blind; turns them to pawns; makes them play the game.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"131\">\"Myths. You're perpetrating myths,\" Harry says, voice crackling with disbelief.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"132\">Bulstrom shrugs. \"It works, doesn't it? The entire country's listening, now.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"133\">\"Not for long, no.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"134\">\"And if I'm not here,&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;still is.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"135\">\"Who?\" Harry questions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"136\">Bulstrom remains silent. Harry sighs and sits down in another old bale of hay, keeping his wand trained on the bound wizard and rubbing his eyes. What he wouldn't give for a cigarette right now! Or maybe some tea. Yes, that would do nicely. Harry has been on too many cases to fall asleep while toting a prisoner around, so he keeps a blank and studious watch of the other wizard.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"137\">After a long while, perhaps two hours by Harry's watch, Bulstrom speaks again.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"138\">\"What was that?\" Harry asks, \"I couldn't hear you.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"139\">\"Agilian, is what I said,\" he replies.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"140\">Harry furrows his brows. \"The drug? What about it?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"141\">There is a slight creak at the barn door. Aleister's eyes widen as Harry whirls to face any intruder just as the barn door, directly behind him, bursts of its hinges and Harry is forced to use a Reductor to keep himself and Bulstrom from being squished.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"142\">Stepping into the wreckage the desolate barn has become is the woman whom had so thoroughly wanted to kill Bulstrom carrying a wand in her right hand and something else that Harry can't quite identify in the darkness settled in her left hand.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"143\">\"Stella, I presume,\" Harry says charmingly, \"Stella of 'The Circus'?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"144\">She wheels around to Bulstrom, sending him a furious glare. She stops a moment before raising her arm with the unidentified object. Harry realizes then that it is a Muggle pistol, and he brings his wand up to cast a shield charm, but Stella is quicker, muttering something that ends up shooting out something purple that blocks Harry's best attempt at a&nbsp;<em>Protego</em>. He can only watch in horror as Bulstrom shakes and struggles against his bindings, which Harry tries, in vain, to loosen as the deranged woman raises the large handgun to his head and fires. His head snaps backwards to an angle Harry thought previously unimaginable, blood spurts out, creating a fine mist across the bales of hay as the now limp Aleister Bulstrom remains bound to the ropes of Harry's&nbsp;<em>incarcerous</em>&nbsp;spell blood dripping town his partially blasted off head. The strange purple aura that prevented Harry from helping the murderer now dissipates as Stella turns to face Harry.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"145\">\"Looks like you've fixed the arm,\" Harry quips, pointing to her now quite usable arm.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"146\">The woman ignores Harry's observation. \"Yes, my name is Stella Gerrard, of 'The Circus', as you call it,\" she affirms, training the same gun that dropped Bulstrom on Harry, \"Call me Gerrard, though.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"147\">\"Gerrard, then,\" Harry amends.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"148\">\"I think you'd like to come with me. Especially if you've attracted the interest of this man's master.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"149\">\"Who is he?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"150\">Ms. Gerrard shakes her head. \"I think you'd like to come with me, Mr. Potter. Much safer for you. And me.\" She touches Bulstrom's corpse with her wand, and a strange green marking is placed on his neck. Harry tries to inspect it, noting that it is a Rune, but he is not given enough time to study the glowing green writing on Bulstrom's body because Gerrard extends out her arm to Harry, which the DCI takes as a call for side-along apparition rather than a friendly handshake, if her grim countenance is anything to go by. Harry searches her face, and seeing no ill-intent aside from if he tries to run away from the black-haired woman, he grasps her arm, and with a sudden jerking motion that makes Harry feel like he's being pulled apart in all directions, they disappear with a pop.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"151\">And land in a strange wizarding facility. It's a large building, and rather oddly reminiscent of the OIM, in Harry's opinion, with a large atrium that appears to be made entirely out of some sort of glass.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"152\">\"Goblin-glass,\" Gerrard says distractedly, ushering Harry along the atrium, though he longs to stay and look at the scenery, which appears to be the nighttime Liverpool traffic. \"It's charmed so we can see out, but no one can see in. And it's stronger than steel.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"153\">\"Oh,\" is all Harry can muster.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"154\">Gerrard stops at a receptionist's desk, a half-moon crescent in shape, just like the one back at the OIM, except with that strange goblin glass everywhere. A woman smiles politely at Gerrard:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"155\">\"Gerrard,\" she intones, \"shall I tell Control you're here with DCI Potter for his appointment?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"156\">Harry's eyes nearly shoot into his hairline. It wouldn't be hard for the woman to tell whom Harry is, but for them to have set up an appointment, they'd have to have known that Harry would be coming here. Did they anticipate this? He turns to Gerrard, who keeps her face in the likeness of a blank stone, ignoring the confused wizard as she speaks:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"157\">\"Yes, Exeter, please patch Control.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"158\">The other woman nods, pressing something behind the table, though Harry can't quite make out what it is that she presses. The unmistakable sound of an intercom crackling to life registers in Harry's ears. For a moment, no noise is made until the woman, whom Gerrard called Exeter, leans into a microphone at the far side of her desk and speaks:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"159\">\"Control, this is Exeter, Gerrard and the DCI are here to see you.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"160\">Only the static of the intercom plays for a moment, and then a flayed, gravelly voice responds. \"Bring them up.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"161\">Exeter, though Harry seriously doubts that is her&nbsp;<em>real</em>&nbsp;name, waves Gerrard and the DCI through. Gerrard moves towards the far side of the atrium, where six glass elevators stand. Gerrard punches the 'up' button for one of them. Harry takes a look up as to how far the elevators travel, and catches the sight of interesting hanging sculpture of the globe, where hundreds of red lights pop up all around the seven continents.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"162\">\"Every Magical Conflict everywhere that we know of,\" Gerrard explains, pushing Harry into an elevator that opens up in front of them. \"Good thing to know for people like us.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"163\">\"And... what kind of people are you?\" Harry questions. Gerrard gives Harry a look that tells him to shut up.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"164\">So he does exactly that, facing forward, bouncing on his toes and letting a gust of air out his mouth. This week just gets stranger and stranger, he idly muses. Serial killers, abandoned pureblood iron foundries, Liverpool, and now a crazy woman who is taking Harry up to see 'Control', whomever that may be.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"165\">He hasn't had this much excitement since Voldemort!</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"166\">But the excitement, Harry knows, can be a bad thing. For one, he still doesn't know what side these 'Circus'-folk are on, as Bulstrom only told him a little before getting his head all blasted off by Gerrard. Hopefully, however, seeing as the Dark Wizard didn't exactly go frolicking into the meadow and out of Harry's grasp due to these people, he can only assume that they are exemplary of the age-old saying 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend'.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"167\">But yet, more questions plague the young Auror: what was that thing about Agilian Bulstrom said before the Circus Agent came bursting through the barn door, and what does it have to do with anything?</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"168\">\"Stop fussing,\" Gerrard orders; at once, Harry stops bouncing on his toes and faces forward as a soldier would.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"169\">Finally, after a time, the elevator doors open and Harry finds himself facing the large globe sculpture, realizing he is now on the seventh floor, the highest, he believes, though he cannot be totally sure. Gerrard leads him down the walkway, a rectangular shape that hugs the walls so as not to interfere with the globe of conflicts. Harry takes a look below, the place seems mostly deserted, but there are a few people in suits running to and fro. On the particular floor he is at contains only one office down the corner, hidden behind oaken double doors.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"170\">\"Get in,\" she barks once in front of the doors, all but shoving the DCI into the office. There awaits another man, similarly dressed to Gerrard though his hood is drawn up, who eyes the exchange amusedly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"171\">\"Control, I have DCI Potter for you.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"172\">\"Thank you, Gerrard,\" he breathes, an American accent tempered by having lived in England for a long time, \"you may go now.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"173\">The stone-faced Gerrard nods, turns heel on the DCI and 'Control', and marches out of the office, a large one that has the same glassy look, but with metal flooring and electronic lighting overhead. For a long time, Harry and the hooded man stare each other down, unmoving, unblinking, until Control speaks:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"174\">\"You really are a bit of a downer, you know that?\" He asks quickly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"175\">Harry shrugs. \"You'd forgive me if I'm not all smiley today; it's been a rotten one, if you ask me.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"176\">The hooded man chuckles, \"Smiley. I think I like that one for you.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"177\">Smiley? For him? What is this man on about? Harry straightens, and with an arched eyebrow, waits for 'Control' to continue:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"178\">\"Forgive my manners,\" Control says, moving round his desk so he is directly in front of Harry, \"but you've attracted my interest, Harry Potter.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"179\">\"Yeah, I get that a lot,\" Harry sighs dramatically.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"180\">\"Well, just be glad I am on your side instead of Bulstrom's,\" Control smirks, Harry allows a small smile to grace his lips. \"I've known of you for quite some time, but then again, who hasn't? Harry Potter, the Wizard-Who-Won! The Chosen One-\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"181\">\"-I always hated that name.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"182\">\"Of course,\" Control graciously admits, \"But there's more to you than that, isn't there? The willingness to sacrifice? I've heard all about your exploits: from the moment your parents were murdered to when you knowingly walked to your own death in that last battle. Very intriguing. And now you're an Auror, yes?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"183\">\"Yes.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"184\">\"Then you know this country's state of affairs, do you not?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"185\">Harry nods.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"186\">\"And you know that you cannot change it through legislature, am I correct?\" Control questions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"187\">\"Yes, we've tried, but the Ministry is not prone to change, and it seems to get worse by day. Talks of war with Russia, or being dragged into one; an increase in violent murder; Pureblood-on-Muggleborn hate crimes; Terrorism; and the Agilian craze, that seemed to come from nowhere. All the MI6 stuff.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"188\">\"Good, at least you're informed. You may be wondering whom I am and just what The Circus is... to be truthful, some would consider us a terrorist group simply because we haven't been legally implemented yet.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"189\">\"Legally implemented?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"190\">\"Do you remember AEL-TA conference from last year? Where you, Ms. Granger, and Mr. Weasley came up with the idea of an International Wizarding Police based off of the Muggle 'Interpol'?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"191\">Harry nods. Last year, in one of his very few public appearances since Voldemort's death, Harry had, with the rest of the newly-named 'Golden Trio' had put forth a charter for Serious Crimes that span Europe and the Americas, a sort of Wizarding Interpol meant to act as a true counter for the rise in terrorism since the end of the war, especially considering the Conference took place merely a month after the September Eleventh Attacks on America. The differences between the U.S.A. and Russia, however, were too strained due to the possibility of Russian interference that may have allowed the Attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon to come through as planned and the resolution, along with the rest of the treaty (which would include international medical and food aid, alongside a parliamentary United Wizarding Nations meant to mediate disputes between member countries).</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"192\">Of course, Harry could only claim to have come up with the bare skeleton of what would become the ATCO, or Anti-Terrorism Coalition, Hermione is the one who had really gone in depth with her studies of Interpol to make it a possibility.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"193\">\"ATCO?\" Harry questions, \"What does that have to do with anything?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"194\">\"Ah, but it has to do with everything,\" Control chides, spreading his arms wide, \"You are looking at the UK Branch of the ATCO, codenamed 'The Circus'. This is your, and to a lesser extent, Ms. Granger's and Mr. Weasley's brainchild.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"195\">\"But... how? This would be illegal, wouldn't it?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"196\">\"Of course, it's illegal! Under British law, that is. Technically we're a terrorist group that shadow functions as the equivalent of a Paramilitary Organization. If, however, as Ms. Granger's Emergency Clause states, there is a clear and present need for us, we're already waiting on orders. Of course, right now, we take orders from the Americans headquartered in Chicago; you three certainly impressed some representative members of the MD-CIA. It's said there's even some KGB action in Petersburg to help make ATCO possible.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"197\">Harry, for lack of a better term, is floored. He moves forward towards Control, reaching out for one of the comfortable leather chairs in front of Control's crescent-shaped office desk, grasping the back and sitting down in it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"198\">\"This. The Circus? It's mine?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"199\">Control shrugs. \"Not entirely. Right now, it's mine, and it could be yours someday, if you're willing to join now. I could even place you in a Management Position.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"200\">\"And if I say no?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"201\">\"Well, then I&nbsp;<em>Obliviate</em>&nbsp;you and send you on your way, implanting false memories of your fight with Bulstrom as well.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"202\">\"Oh.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"203\">That's quite the proposal. A shadow group being set up throughout all the relevant Magical World as an illegal variant of the ATCO idea he had pitched to Hermione two days after the September Eleventh Attacks, when things were much more hectic. Even as a Healer, Hermione has always been better at political science than Harry could ever dream being, and so she decided to help him. Ron put in his two cents every now and then, and by October 1st, the simply idea Harry had mentioned half-a-month earlier was practically finished. Hermione and Ron agreed with Harry, it was brilliant. Of course, with the sniping of AEL-TA, ATCO went down as well, so Harry simply resigned his fate to working in the very imperfect Auror department. But to find out now that ATCO was still being pursued by people hidden within the governmental fabric of their country, it makes Harry excited for the first time in a very long time.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"204\">Harry sighs. \"It sounds fantastic, really. But I work for the government, and if they were to find out that The Circus existed, then who knows what might happen? The might charge me of treason, they may say you're trying to start a revolution. These are unstable times, and any threat to power is almost always crushed.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"205\">\"Revolution is the right of the people. And to protect oneself from revolution is the right of the government. They can do what they will, but if the government itself proves too corrupt, it's only a matter of time before they fall.\" Control stops, \"And, truthfully, did not your Godson's mother work for the government and a terrorist group at the same time?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"206\">Right. The Order of the Phoenix. \"I wouldn't consider them a terrorist group-\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"207\">\"Right, neither would I. But, be that as it may, the Ministry would have considered them such,\" Control replies, \"If there were no evidence of Voldemort's return, Alastor Moody and Nymphadora Tonks would have been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. But, as you can see, the law is the problem; not all the politicking in the world could kickstart AEL-TA's heartbeat, not until the Yanks and the Russians are ready to kiss and make-up. It's at that point when our 'Revolution', the one that is meant to help the Muggleborns, put an end to the recent rise of terrorism, the drug-dependency of the country-\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"208\">\"-Must go into the hands of the people,\" Harry finishes for him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"209\">Control nods vigorously. \"It's their inalienable right,&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;inalienable right to change things when the government does not run as it should. And if it does not run as it should, we need to be informed, and able to defend ourselves.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"210\">\"And ATCO is where it starts?\" Harry questions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"211\">\"Yes, right here, in The Circus,\" Control replies, \"And&nbsp;<em>La R&eacute;sistance&nbsp;</em>in France, and The Lake in America, so on and so forth.\" He pauses, giving Harry time to mull over the information he's just been given. \"Are you willing to help us?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"212\">Harry knows that ATCO, is legalized, could be the most vital boon to a continent mired in war over the last hundred years, magical and muggle alike. But joining ATCO would place Harry at direct odds with the Government he works for, place his friends and family at risk. And he could easily be branded traitor and terrorist if ATCO is found out, and that, moreover it is&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;brainchild. At least if he refused, Harry could claim having no association with people who had liked his ideas and turned it into a radical terrorist group, but if he joined... there could be no deniability.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"213\">But, this is a noble cause, and Harry could tell, that despite being a secretive man, Control has no intent to harm. Harry would likely already be dead if so.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"214\">And he is right, Moody and Tonks joined the Order of the Phoenix even though it was considered a terrorist group apparently seeking a coup d'etat where they could install Dumbledore as the Minister, and despite that they&nbsp;<em>worked</em>&nbsp;for the Ministry that was so afraid of The Order. And the Ministry was wrong wasn't it?</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"215\">And the Ministry today is all wrong, too. Getting into Pureblood vs. Muggleborn riots, losing ground in the Drug War, and now the corruption is starting to shine through again, despite Minister Shacklebolt's best attempts at keeping the Ministry in check. Bribes win jobs once more, blood segregation is starting to take hold again, and it won't be long before another Voldemort can find England a place to foster his ideas.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"216\">And with that, Harry looks up. \"Yes. I'll take it. But I don't want a Management Position. I want to start where everyone else does.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"217\">\"Good,\" Control smiles, \"I was hoping you'd want to do this on your own. Since we aren't a legal group and can't really offer any pay, your job is the same job you work right now, as an Auror. But keep us informed, find out things within the inner-workings of the government.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"218\">Harry nods. \"And what of Bulstrom? Why'd you kill him?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"219\">\"He knows about The Circus and is not member. Furthermore, he killed children in the name of a Wizard we're hunting down.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"220\">\"Have you got a name?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"221\">\"None yet,\" Control replies, \"The man's a shadow. Don't have a name, or group, just that people have been popping up all over Europe, killing people and claiming that they serve someone who 'plays the game'.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"222\">\"Chess?\" Harry questions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"223\">\"Yes. We're keeping an eye out for him, and try to question those working for him, but Bulstrom has proven already to be useless, and the killings were simply us being unable to track him down, which you did quite admirable for us, DCI Potter. Speaking of which, it wouldn't do us any good to be referring to you by given name, now would it, Smiley?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"224\">\"Smiley?\" Harry snorts.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"225\">\"What? I think it's rather good!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"226\">\"If you say so.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"227\">Control smacks the the top of his desk in good-humor. \"Now, our meeting is done, but there are still things to be done about Bulstrom. He's obviously dead and you're missing. Ministry Aurors are already scouting out around Liverpool, and none can know you were here. So, I'll have to cast a spell on you to avoid any suspicions of where he might be.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"228\">\"A spell?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"229\">\"It's called a charm-cocktail, meant to provide numerous symptoms that will keep Healers busy for a while. You would wake up in four days, likely, at St. Mungo's. You will have killed Aleister Bulstrom in self-defense, using a&nbsp;<em>Waddiwasi</em>spell to collapse a boulder atop him, though not before he hit you with a strange spell that knocked you out immediately.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"230\">Harry nods.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"231\">\"After you awake, you will return to work as per usual, and we will contact you within the week.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"232\">\"Okay.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"233\">Control slightly flicks his wrist, and a wand appears in his right hand. He points it at Harry. \"Are you ready?\" He asks; Harry nods. Control raises his arm and whispers \"<em>Infringo</em>,\" whilst waving his wand about as something silvery hits Harry in the chest, making him feel very drowsy before he falls away into the darkness.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"234\"><strong>A/N:&nbsp;</strong>An Anti-terrorist terrorist group?

The moment she had stepped into his and Ron's compartment on the Hogwarts' Express over a decade earlier, there was something special about Harry Potter. More than his fame, or that lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead, but something about his mannerisms: his politeness, his optimism, his innocence had turned this eleven year-old boy into someone truly special. He was a child at heart, curious, innocent, full of na&iuml;vet&eacute;, and that made him so very endearing to everyone he met.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"7\">Hermione had become too old by this time to deny it: she had fancied the childish Harry Potter. He was her knight in shining armor. The one who saved her from the troll, the one who fought Voldemort three times and won thrice by his thirteenth birthday. Perhaps it was a passing fancy, and one she herself did not recognize, but through her first four years, Hermione had eyes for no one but her absolutely platonic best friend Harry.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"8\">It was after Cedric Diggory's death that she had seen Harry change. The downtrodden, but hopeful young boy became a young man with the world placed on his shoulders. He snapped at others, he tried his best to save everyone, and took it personally when he could not save a person. Hermione supposed he entered the ethical stage of his life then: always concerned with numbers; how many did he save, how many more did he leave to rot? Hermione knew that her friend was driving himself insane, but what could she do? She tried to help him until Sirius had died, but it was by then that Harry was too far gone. The Prophecy had turned him into an unrepentant Fatalist more obsessed with his death than his life. He never spoke of it, but when he thought she or Ron were not watching, Harry would develop a strange, intense, penetrating stare at nothing, looking for all the world like a man ready to off himself.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"9\">It had scared Hermione. She got into fights with Harry during their sixth year, yes, but none of it was so petty as Potions Class, as Harry had been led to believe. It was clear that Harry was fast becoming a lunatic while Ron, even in the height of his stupidity with Lavender Brown, was far more even-keeled than the near-suicidal Potter. One of her friends was ignoring her because he was a git and she was a prat, and the other tried to mask his obvious and all-consuming depression with Quidditch and a girl named Ginny. It was enough to make&nbsp;<em>anyone</em>&nbsp;a little bit loopy, Hermione thought.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"10\">But what grew out of that was a hero. Not the kind that made Hermione go weak in the knees like she did at the sight of Harry during their second year, but a fierce, brave, loyal man she had grown to respect and love as a brother over their nine-month Horcrux search. One who chose to die for everyone else; a Jesus Christ in disguise!</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"11\">But the third metamorphosis was perhaps Harry's most terrifying. Hermione knew enough stories about Harry's childhood to know he was a rather neglected child. And he had spent his entire Hogwarts career preparing for the ultimate final battle with Voldemort. And at the end of the tunnel was money, fame, and a girl who loved him. Surely Harry must have wanted peace after all his fighting and warring with one of the world's most fearsome terrorists. At least, that's what Ron had thought.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"12\">Hermione had to stifle a reflexive smile. Ron may have been Harry's best mate, but, truthfully, she knew Harry far better than Ron could have ever hoped. Harry was not the man, though he tried to say he was, to be satisfied by a wife and kids and a large mansion and money being thrown his way. But he had thought he did, and probably didn't understand why his relationship with Ginny failed, because, ultimately, she was on the backburners over something as petty as a job. At least, that was what others thought.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"13\">But she knew better. Catching Dark Wizards was more than just a job for Harry, it was an obsession. He faced his equal in Voldemort, and won. So what is to be done after that, live a happy life with a wife and children? No. It just wasn't the life for her friend. Harry would always be searching, obsessively seeking another equal, another person like Voldemort... someone that he could fight and hate.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"14\">Truthfully, the signs began immediately after defeating Voldemort; Harry had been exceptionally mopey for a man who had just defeated his arch-nemesis and lift the curse of the prophecy off himself once and for all. But that was all expected by some, Hermione had not noticed the signs until Harry and Ginny broke up a few months earlier. She visited the reclusive Auror's then-new flat in Bristol and asked him why he didn't want Ginny when all she wanted to do was make Harry happy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"15\">And his response? \"Happiness is useless,\" the tosser had said.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"16\">So there arose a wanderer, someone constantly searching for his place in life, but finding none. Ron didn't see it, Ginny did not, even Harry probably did not see how lost he was, but Hermione did.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"17\">And what did she see now? Now that her best friend lay in a bed in St. Mungo's having been in a coma for four days now, all because he wanted the thrill of being the only one left to face down Aleister Bulstrom. Ron may have said it was brave, and that Harry put the girl's life before his own, but, once again, she knew Harry better than he did, and this had nothing to do with the courage and everything to do with boredom. He wouldn't be bored so long as there was someone to fight, and fight alone, right?</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"18\">He&nbsp;<em>had</em>&nbsp;changed. And it made Hermione feel even worse for her friend, who was not dead, but emotionally, mentally, had died alongside Voldemort.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"19\">But, nevertheless, he was family, and she had to take care of family. Even when they were being stubborn and stupid. So Hermione sat by his bed in Room 321 of St. Mungo's MICU, or Magical Intensive Care Unit, holding Harry's unresponsive left hand, and waited. In trying to wake Harry up, the Healers had left no stone unturned, no method untried, but the results always came back the same, Harry would have to try to come out of this coma of his on his own.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"20\">Her eyes roved over every part of him. Built like a football Defender at 6'2\" and at 83 kilograms, Harry had continued his unexplained growth spurt even into his twenties, and while he was not as tall or big as Ron, who was an inch taller and built like a Rugby player, Harry possessed an unnatural strength that seemed to radiate out from his body that even when he faced down taller and bigger Ronald, the redhead seemed to shrink. It was amazing to think that this man in front of Hermione was the same boy she had made acquaintance with on Hogwarts' Express years ago.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"21\">But all he did was lie there. No movement of the eyes, apparently no REM whatsoever, signifying of a coma. But she had lunch right now, and Ron was out working, so she stayed with her other friend and read a book and held his hand while he slumbered.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"22\">But, a quarter until noon, Hermione felt a sudden movement from Harry's hand. He had squeezed hers. For a moment, her heart fluttered and her stomach did a backflip, as she turned to find the man she considered a brother staring at her.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"23\">\"Herm...\" he wheezed, his vocal cords unused to speaking and his throat was probably dry. He sat up gingerly as Hermione took her hand out from his.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"24\">\"Hold on,\" Hermione replied, grabbing a cup of water off a long forgotten tray, she brought it to the raven-haired Auror's mouth, who accepted the water greedily.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"25\">Once finished, he looked up at the ceiling, down at his bed, and back to Hermione. \"How long... have I been out?\" Harry questioned, his voice still sounding cracked and dry.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"26\">\"Four days,\" she responded, feeding him water once more. The DCI graciously accepted. \"Found you on a bench in Hyde Park.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"27\">\"Bulstrom?\" He asked suddenly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"28\">Hermione shook her head. \"Dead. Apparently you collapsed a boulder on the bastard.\" Harry eyed her in shock, obviously never having heard her swear so flippantly, but he recovered quickly:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"29\">\"Thought I did something like that...\" he replied, \"but he'd hit me with that spell before I could make sure. Must've happened at the same time. Don't remember much. It's all a bit hazy.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"30\">Hermione looked at the Auror for a moment before she launched herself into his arms. \"You stupid, stupid,&nbsp;<em>stupid</em>&nbsp;man!\" She all but shrieked into his shoulder, \"Do you know how worried Ron and I were for you? And Ginny? I don't think she left your bedside!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"31\">Harry hugged her back. \"I'm sorry, Hermione.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"32\">She recoiled, moving out of the of the embrace so she could look him in the eyes. \"No you're not,\" she replied, a little bit cross.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"33\">He smiled ruefully. \"No. No, I'm not.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"34\">\"Did you enjoy it, at least?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"35\">\"No, not really,\" Harry sighed, smiling at Hermione, \"He turned out to be really boring, actually.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"36\">Hermione snorted in response. \"Serves you right for doing that to us.\" Her face suddenly turns serious. \"Harry, you know that this is not helping you. You need to talk to someone. Need to talk to me. Or Ron.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"37\">He shook his head. \"No.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"38\">Hermione was growing exasperated. \"Why do you have to be so&nbsp;<em>stubborn</em>?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"39\">\"You've known me for half of your life, when have I ever&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;been stubborn?\" Harry questioned lightly, \"But, I understand. You want me to stop isolating myself from everyone. I can't do that. I can't come back. This is the way things should be.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"40\">\"And what about Ginny? You know she loves you.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"41\">\"Better she forget about me than love me when I can't love back.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"42\">\"So... you're willing to just lose her forever?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"43\">Harry shook his head and replied in a cryptic manner: \"Some things are better left lost.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"44\">\"And Ron and I? What about us?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"45\">Harry shrugged. \"You two are in love. Why would I get in the way of that?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"46\">\"Get in the way of that?\" Hermione exclaims, \"Harry, you've been our best friend for years; what makes you think you'd be a nuisance? I just don't like what you're doing to yourself, and I'm sure Ron wouldn't if he knew!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"47\">\"And what am I doing to myself?\" The DCI asked, his head cocked to the side in an inquisitive manner. And there it is again, that unnerving stare that makes Hermione's stomach turn over and leaves her slightly lightheaded. But she steels herself for what she must say next, even if Harry won't listen:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"48\">\"Don't be pigheaded, Harry,\" she retorted hotly, \"I had to run diagnostics tests on you, you know that? You have remnants of Agilian in your system,\" she finished, barely whispering the last part. Harry's head fell, as if he had not accounted for such a thing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"49\">The two remained silent for a long time.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"50\">\"So,\" Harry started at length, \"what now?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"51\">\"Well, what else?\" You tell me why.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"52\">\"Or?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"53\">\"Or I tell Ron, and have him tell Granath.\" Hermione winced, her voice came off as sounding more acidic than it should have and caused Harry to glare. So she decided to switch tactics, and placed a comforting arm on his shoulder before speaking again. \"Harry, it would be for your own good.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"54\">Harry placed his face into his outstretched palms, as if thinking, before speaking. \"Okay,\" he said, realizing that he had no other option, \"You're probably the most well-learned witch I know, so you might know about this. First, can you cast a silencing spell?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"55\">Hermione nodded, raising her wand and saying '<em>Muffliato</em>' before allowing Harry to continue:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"56\">\"Have you ever heard of the Zeitgeist Phenomena?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"57\">Hermione assumed she must have looked confused, as she had never heard anyone say that before, nor had she read it in any of her books. \"No,\" she admitted at length.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"58\">\"I wouldn't expect many people to, but, in times of war, it can become surprisingly common,\" Harry replied, scratching the unshaven growth of beard stubble on his jaw thoughtfully, \"It stems from the use of the&nbsp;<em>Avada Kedavra</em>&nbsp;curse. The Killing Curse is unforgivable, that is true, but its shadow function is far more dangerous than simply killing someone. It's believed, that the Avada Kedavra was originally invented as a cousin of the&nbsp;<em>Legilimens</em>&nbsp;spell, meant to enter the mind, but rather than use to learn of one's secrets, it was meant to steal them. Some say the muggle trick 'Abra Cadabra' is a bastardization of the real spell, signifying something that was there in the victim's psyche one moment, a dream, a memory, an idea, was gone the next.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"59\">\"It's said that every person someone kills with the Avada Kedavra curse, the user steals steals a fragment of the victim and it melds into his own psyche. The more you kill, the more you become a amalgamation of all those you've killed, hence, the 'Zeitgeist' Phenomena.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"60\">Hermione looked at Harry intently. \"What does this have to do with you?\" She interrogated.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"61\">\"Everything,\" Harry cryptically responded, \"How many people do you think Voldemort killed?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"62\">\"Hundreds,\" Hermione starts, \"if not thousands. But what-<em>oh</em>!\" The honey-haired healer clamped one hand to her mouth and another through her delicate golden-brown tresses in understanding.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"63\">Harry grinned. \"You get it now?\" He questioned.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"64\">Hermione could only nod. \"He killed all those people, so he was a practical chimera made up of all those he murdered. And you, didn't you tell us that when you and Voldemort fought, the moment the Avada Kedavra rebounded, it became your spell?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"65\">\"Eidetic Memory serves you well,\" Harry praised; Hermione blushed lightly, \"Even though I sent a disarming charm at him, it overpowered Voldemort's killing curse and combined with my&nbsp;<em>Expelliarmus&nbsp;</em>to kill him. Even though I never uttered those words, and the&nbsp;<em>Avada Kedavra</em>&nbsp;was never cast by the Elder Wand, by being so closely associated with Voldemort all my life, the spells connected and were considered&nbsp;<em>mine</em>. And so, here-\" he points to his head, \"-I live with the pay-off.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"66\">Hermione blanched. \"You mean, he's-\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"67\">\"No, no, he's not in there. I've stolen a part of him and made Voldemort Harry Potter. And in some ways, I've taken another shade of every person he's killed as well, from my parents to Snape to various Death Eaters.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"68\">\"So, you're...\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"69\">\"No,\" Harry countered, anticipating Hermione's remark, \"I'm still Harry Potter, for the most part. I still retain my morals, I just have different mannerisms, ways of thinking about things, so on and so forth.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"70\">\"Like what?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"71\">\"Well,\" Harry began thoughtfully, \"It turns out Riddle was quite drug-dependent. I know, it was a shock to me, too. But, the craving passed on, and while Agilian did not exist then for Tom Riddle, it is the preferred method for Harry Potter. And chess. I used to be mediocre at it, Ron would beat me all the time. Now, I think differently, almost twenty steps ahead, and Ron rarely wins.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"72\">Hermione chuckled. \"I remember he was right cross about that,\" she said, before turning serious, \"But, are you really, I mean-is a bit of him really up there?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"73\">\"Not entirely, but, in a basic sense, yes. I swear it on my life, Hermione,\" Harry replied sincerely.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"74\">\"I'm sorry.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"75\">\"Don't be, the world's a colder place, but that's about it.\" Harry snarked lightly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"76\">She hugged him again. \"But you can't do this, Harry,\" she protested whilst squeezing her best friend tightly, \"You can't kill yourself with Agilian. First, it's&nbsp;<em>illegal</em>, and second, it's no better than Heroin or Cocaine, it will kill you eventually, and I've heard that it can turn people insane if they overdose.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"77\">\"I'm trying to cut down to cigarettes and cigars,\" Harry replied.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"78\">\"That still won't help, Harry,\" Hermione mused, \"You know that those will give you cancer, and as brilliant as magic can be, it can't stop the uncontrolled growth of radiated cells. As you grow older, you could develop lung or throat cancer, emphysema, increased chances of CHD, strokes, chronic bronchitis-\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"79\">Harry smiled. \"Alright, alright, Hermione, I don't need a human encyclopedia on the health risks of smoking!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"80\">Hermione broke of their embrace, face pulled into a grim, but strangely resplendent smile on her face. \"But, still...\" she paused for a moment and bit her lower lip in deep concentration. \"I'll help you,\" she said at length.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"81\">\"You'll help me?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"82\">Hermione nodded happily. \"I'll help you kick the habit, you can go back to being as you were before you fought Voldemort! I don't know how, but I can figure it out.\" Harry could not help but smile, definitely knowing better than to doubt his dearest friend could do anything she put her mind to.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"83\">\"Okay, okay,\" he responded lightly. \"So this stays between us for now?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"84\">\"Absolutely. Now you get some rest, another Healer will be coming in for mandatory check-ups and I'm sure there will be a lot of people coming by to see you soon,\" Hermione nodded, \"And no cigarettes, Harry. None!\" Harry chuckled as the honey-haired woman stepped out of his room.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"85\">He looked around, completely floored by what had just happened just as the door Hermione closed no less than fifteen seconds earlier banged open, revealing a furious Detective-Superintendent Granath and a sheepish Ron.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"86\">\"Heard you were up,\" Granath spat. \"You're out of London.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"87\">Harry gave his superior a flummoxed look, \"I'm what?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"88\">\"Chief-Superintendent Stark didn't like your...&nbsp;<em>indiscretion</em>&nbsp;over this Bulstrom case. For the next six months, you're out of SCU, and, by extension, out of London. First thing he said was to keep you out until you grow up.\" Granath stepped forward with a file that Harry grabbed out of his hand, \"No more Homicides, you've been detailed on an Agilian drug-running crew. The biggest outside Bristol, and apparently a big dog up in Liverpool.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"89\">\"Liverpool? Why Liverpool?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"90\">\"Something about that city, it just doesn't feel right. They someone's amassing something there, but don't know what yet.\" Harry's eyes widened at Granath's statement, The Circus was located in Liverpool! \"There's been an increase in drug trade and dark magic in that city. Who knows what's going on up there, other than that you've been detailed.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"91\">But, then again, Bulstrom had said something about Liverpool being a dangerous city, perhaps a gateway for whatever 'Master' he had.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"92\">\"Agilian,\" Harry remarked; his whole&nbsp;<em>life</em>&nbsp;seemed to revolve around the drug trade those days, \"And no London or Bristol.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"93\">\"You'll be allowed to return home every once in a while, but as of now, you work well-undercover in Liverpool,\" Granath grumbled, \"Drug dealing. Merlin, they have you working on drugs!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"94\">\"Somebody has to do it,\" Harry replied, shrugging.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"95\">Granath raised an eyebrow. \"Not at the expense of solving&nbsp;<em>real</em>&nbsp;crimes.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"96\">Harry had long known how Granath felt about the drug trade and the valuable Auror resources being wasted to fight it, citing it as a petty crime that distracted Aurors from doing their actual jobs of solving murders or breaking codes or protecting people. The only time, he said, that Aurors should waste resources on the Drug Trade was when a murder was the direct outcome of it. But, still, Detective-Superintendent Granath was an honorable man who would never go against orders, even if it was taking his DCI to Liverpool to capture some Agilian slingers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"97\">\"Still,\" he said, mimicking Harry's thoughts just a moment earlier, \"Orders are orders, and the CS expects you up there once you're cleared by the hospital and have a little chat with him.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"98\">Harry nodded. \"Sorry, Granath,\" he said, \"we were supposed to go to Fahranar for recon, and it just so happened that the girl was there. We didn't really expect for any of this to happen.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"99\">\"I know, I know,\" Granath replied, \"I'm not saying anything you did was wrong, except maybe working with Helene-Harry, you&nbsp;<em>know</em>&nbsp;she's trouble no matter what help she offers- but, next time, it would be nice to&nbsp;<em>inform</em>&nbsp;us where you're taking DS Weasley and yourself at all hours of the night.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"100\">The door opened once more, revealing an unfamiliar Healer, who looked at the three Aurors rather nervously.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"101\">\"Healer Granger has told me to check up on DCI Potter,\" she said meekly, \"I'll need you two to leave for now.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"102\">Granath looked from Harry to Ron, and nodded at the redhead. They both turned and headed out the way they came as the Healer came forward. Granath, however, stopped at the door:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"103\">\"Remember, you've got a meeting with the CS first thing when you get back to the OIM,\" the elder man ordered, \"and pack up whatever you need, your new office is at the Liverpool branch of the Irish Metre.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"104\">\"The NIM?\" Ron questioned.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"105\">\"Yes, the&nbsp;<em>New&nbsp;</em>Irish Metre. They say it's supposed to be very fancy,\" Granath replied, \"Enjoy your check-up, Potter.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"106\">With that, the two Aurors turned heel and left Harry to the healer and his thoughts. Said healer fussed over the injured Auror for a little while, stating that he had Ron (whom she referred to as Auror Weasley) and Healer Granger very worried about him. She also told him that Ginny Weasley didn't leave Harry's bedside for an entire day, and only allowed herself to be separated because Hermione had forced the redhead to leave. But, once all the lecturing was done, the Healer told him that he would be discharged later in the evening and that he should get some rest before then. So, Harry complied, laying down and resting his head before he started to ponder his relationship with Ginny and the strange conversation he had with Hermione no less than half-an-hour beforehand.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"107\">And soon, he fell asleep, thinking of the past.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"108\"><em>May 3, 1998. 7:36 AM<br />Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, UK</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"109\">Harry surveyed the blasted ruins around him, looking upon the stones where Voldemort had fallen only the night before. His life and future prospects stretched out before him alongside the ruined but sacredly beautiful Scottish moor surrounding him, and children and displaced families, caught up in the postwar glow, ran happily together hugging and kissing, playing games and telling jokes, looking up in reverence to their beloved savior: Harry Potter. But Harry felt nothing, no happiness, no joy, no wants for hugs or kisses, games or jokes. It was as if a gloaming had set in about his life, and when he should believe the dawn was just around the bend, only night fast approached. So there he sat on a blasted pillar, looking for all the world like a traveler, staring placidly upon the sea of fog rolling up out of the Forbidden Forest and onto the school grounds.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"110\">Harry's reunion with Hermione was muted at best, feeling only a distant pang of regret when she punched him in the chest and lectured him on how stupid he was for sacrificing himself. His meeting with Ginny did not go well. She snogged him to oblivion the night before, probably to forget about Fred's death, but he had felt nothing, not from the kiss and not for her. He and Ron talked late into all hours of the night, but he felt nothing. He had a rich and hearty breakfast, but it all tasted as cardboard.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"111\">Harry wanted to do something, anything that made it feel right. He hoped sitting on this ledge and watching the families play would help, but even the children, and the students of Hogwarts reuniting with their parents did not fill Harry with any sort of peace or sense of inner-fulfillment. He felt hungry, like he wanted&nbsp;<em>more</em>. He had spent the last nine months hiding in a small tent with Hermione, on a fool's errand to destroy Voldemort's horcruxes, and now that it was finished, he felt nothing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"112\">He did not feel at peace. He did not feel anything. He had won, but he'd never felt so... empty. It was as if Voldemort had won from beyond the grave. He felt nothing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"113\">He wanted more.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"114\">More war, more fighting, more pain. What was the point of peace but to herd sheep? Sheep like these people in front of him who gawp at Harry like he was the Second Coming. What point was there to being the God to these people? What did it matter? He knew that times in front of him, dating Ginny, having children (prior to the end of the war, he had thought he wanted three at the very least), setting playdates with Ron and Hermione... what did that matter? It was the tent, being confined, having his wits tested by Voldemort, and his emotions and sanity tested by Ron's departure and Hermione's depression, that meant anything. Fighting Voldemort was all he thought about for seven years, and now that Voldemort was dead, Harry felt empty without the next great challenge.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"115\">He started to laugh. A deep, rich laugh that could only be uttered by a man who had seen God or by a mentally ill convalescent.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"116\">He was broken! Gloriously, freely broken! And he laughed! Voldemort had won! Dumbledore had lost! The world was saved, but Harry's soul paid the price.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"117\">\"What's so funny?\" A soft voice asked behind the raven-haired adolescent. It wouldn't take Harry the effort to turn around to know it was his best friend and closest confidant over the past seven years, and his closest ally over the past nine months, Hermione Granger.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"118\">Harry paused as she sat down on the pillar next to him, her normally bushy hair having fallen into soft, gently mussed golden-brown tresses due to a recent shower.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"119\">\"Where's Ron?\" Harry asked.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"120\">Hermione smiled. \"Sleeping like a big, snoring, baby.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"121\">\"And Ginny?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"122\">\"Down having breakfast with the rest of the Weasleys. I thought it would be best for them to grieve as a family.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"123\">He looked out over the fog once more and saw the children and their parents playing all around the grounds:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"124\">\"Look at them,\" he said, \"they're so happy.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"125\">Hermione smiled, her eyes crinkling as she turned to Harry. \"I know. It's wonderful, isn't it? We're&nbsp;<em>finally</em>&nbsp;at peace.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"126\">\"Is that a good thing?\" He mused, more to himself than Hermione, but felt her chocolate-brown eyes on his as she worked up the nerve to inquire after that statement:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"127\">\"Why wouldn't it be a good thing?\" Hermione asked, swinging her legs over the ledge and cocking her head to the side in a questioning manner.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"128\">Harry sighed. \"Have you ever felt... I dunno, stuck, before?\" Hermione's eyes blinked uncomprehendingly, beckoning for Harry to explain himself. \"I don't know where to go from here. I've spent so much of my life protecting myself or trying to kill Voldemort, and now... I just never thought about what would happen afterward. Probably never thought I'd survive.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"129\">Hermione bit her lower lip, absentmindedly wringing her hands in deep thought. \"I thought you were going to be an Auror.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"130\">Harry barked out a cynical laugh. \"I&nbsp;<em>know</em>&nbsp;I'm going to do that, but I feel... I feel like it's an afterthought. These last seven years, with you and Ron, at Hogwarts and on the run, this was my life, and everything afterward is just there for the sake of being there. I don't have a family to go back to, and I don't have anyone to grieve for. Except, maybe, Voldemort.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"131\">\"Why would you grieve for&nbsp;<em>him</em>?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"132\">\"Because he was me,\" Harry remarked cryptically, \"and Dumbledore. And Snape. As much as we wanted to kill the other at times, we were the only ones who could understand each other. And I'm afraid I'm the last one left.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"133\">\"You are not alone, Harry Potter. Ron, Ginny, and I are here,\" Hermione said, trying to calm him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"134\">Harry's gaze was serious as he spoke. \"After this, we're all alone. Ron will no doubt be joining either Gringotts at Bill's behest or joining George at the joke shop, Ginny will be at school, and I will be stuck at Auror School. And you probably don't want to waste time hunting down Dark Wizards.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"135\">Hermione flashed a wry grin at the wizard, \"Oh, I don't know about that. You've dragged me into so many adventures that I might just think that Auror-work is right up my alley.\" Harry smiled too. \"Of course, I won't be doing it immediately; I've been extended an offer to complete Healer training at St. Mungos. Maybe once I get bored of hospital work, I'll come join you, right?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"136\">\"But how long is that?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"137\">\"Oh, hush,\" she chided, \"You're just in a rut, I can see why, given how much of your life has revolved around V-Voldemort. But you'll get out of it, I promise. And if Ron and Ginny aren't around, I'll be there for you, won't I?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"138\">Harry watched the fog, contemplating Hermione's advice.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"139\">\"Won't I?\" She repeated.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"140\">Harry nodded vigorously. \"Yes.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"141\">\"That's a good Harry,\" she smiled, leaning into his shoulder, \"but before all of that, you know I have to go to Australia.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"142\">\"Right. To pick up your parents.\" Harry said, Hermione nodded, her temple moving alongside the fabric of his shirt. \"Would you like some company? Ron and I could come with.\" Harry asked; he had nothing better to do, and to get away from the U.K., for a few days at least, would be a welcome distraction.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"143\">Hermione looked up at the raven-haired boy. \"I'd like that, Harry,\" she said softly before the two went back to staring at the families dancing in the fog, and Harry felt much better after having talked to his best friend than he had in months.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"144\"><em>August 31, 2002. 7:15 PM<br />St. Mungo's Hospital, London, UK</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"145\">Harry's eyes opened, staring at a very unfamiliar ceiling. It took him a moment to find his glasses on the nightstand next to his cot and place them on. When he did, he saw Hermione, Ginny, and a preteen girl who looked to be the spitting image of Hermione watching him intently. Feeling a little uncomfortable, Harry waved at the two brunettes and the redhead:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"146\">\"Uh... hi,\" he said awkwardly; Ginny smiled:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"147\">\"Hi, Harry,\" she said softly, moving to hug him, which the dark-haired Auror accepted, though he felt nothing when he wrapped the girl up in his arms. She was beautiful, she smelled nice, but the only thing Harry felt was a distant brotherly protectiveness of Ginny.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"148\">\"How are you feeling?\" Hermione asked from the corner, holding the little girl's hand.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"149\">\"Ugh,\" Harry gripped his sore abdominal muscles, \"like I was run over by a herd of hippogriffs.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"150\">Hermione and Ginny chuckled as a small voice interrupted meekly: \"I've read about them. Is it true that you flew one?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"151\">Harry blinked, now recognizing the girl for whom she really was. Strange resemblance to his best friend of eleven years notwithstanding, this was neither Hermione's long-lost sister or remarkably old daughter, but rather the muggleborn Harry had saved from Aleister Bulstrom, Freya Thompson. Adopting a softer tone of voice than his normally gruff one used to bark out orders, Harry beckoned the little girl forward towards him:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"152\">\"I sure did. My friend Hermione over there did, too,\" he said, smiling, before he extended out his hand, \"My name's Harry, and you're Freya, am I right? Sorry I didn't get to speak with you earlier.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"153\">\"Oh, no,\" Freya replied, moving up to Harry to shake his hand, her eyes twinkling in a manner reminiscent of the late Albus Dumbledore, \"That's understandable.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"154\">Harry tried to stretch, but his body felt far too stiff. \"Ouch,\" he muttered, rubbing his shoulders which caused Ginny to laugh, a mischievous glint in her eyes. Ignoring that his friends found amusement in his suffering an his bodies protestations, Harry swung his legs over the bed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"155\">\"Am I cleared to go?\" He asked, Hermione nodded:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"156\">\"Just let me do a few diagnostic spells before you go,\" Hermione stood, walked over to her sitting patient, muttered some incantations in Latin and made a few complicated swishes of her wand as a strange, alien feeling of calm stole over Harry. He smiled involuntarily at him and Hermione wore a bemused smirk at her best friend's reaction before her eyes focused past Harry at something he himself couldn't quite see. After a long moment of reading something no one else in the room could see, Hermione turned her gaze upon Harry's eyes:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"157\">\"I think you're ready to be cleared,\" she said, Harry thanked her and looked around for his clothes. When he saw none, he turned back to the Healer and his ex-girlfriend:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"158\">\"Do I have decent clothes to change into?\" Ginny shrugged, Hermione nodded once again, and Freya blushed, no doubt uncomfortable to be in a room with a half-naked man.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"159\">Hermione pointed to a closet nearby his bathroom. \"The clothes you were found in have been cleaned, they're in the closet over there. You can change in the water-closet.\" Harry fixed a befuddled stare at the brunette, wondering where else he was supposed to change clothes other than the loo.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"160\">\"Thanks,\" Harry stood and moved to the closet, finding the clothes he had been wearing that evening four days earlier washed or dry-cleaned. He stalked into the bathroom and changed out of his hospital gown and into the clothes from the closet, before returning to the area where the three females awaited him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"161\">\"I feel much better, now,\" Harry said and moved towards Freya, crouched to her level and smiled, \"How are you feeling, Ms. Thompson?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"162\">The little girl stared at the floor, averting her gaze. \"Better, I s'pose,\" she mumbled.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"163\">\"Good,\" he smiled, patting the little girl's head, \"You start Hogwarts tomorrow, right?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"164\">Freya nodded, causing Harry to smile. \"Have you learned anything about it?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"165\">\"Oh, yes!\" Freya exclaimed, now looking back up to meet Harry's eyes, \"I read all about in&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts, A History</em>. I don't know what House I want to go to, but I think I'd like to be in Ravenclaw, or maybe Gryffindor like you and Mr. Weasley and Miss Hermione here!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"166\">Harry chuckled, facing Hermione. \"She sounds like you,\" Hermione had the decency to blush, and Harry turned back to the miniature version of his friend, \"I remember my first day. I met Ron and Hermione over here on the train ride to the school. It was the start to what were probably the best few years of my life.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"167\">\"But you're not that old, how can you tell whether they're the&nbsp;<em>best</em>&nbsp;years of your life?\" Ginny snarks in good-humor.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"168\">Harry shrugs. \"Not old? Depends on who you ask.\" He stood, \"Well, I have to go. Stark wants me on the next train to Liverpool for the next six months, probably got fed up with my being nearby.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"169\">Hermione's eyes widened, and even Ginny looked shocked. \"<em>Six months</em>?\" The brunette asked, \"That's a little overboard, don't you think? What are they going to do without you, Harry?\" The raven-haired wizard shrugged:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"170\">\"Probably going to move Draco up to Acting DCI,\" Harry chuckled at the disgusted faces both of his friends make, \"Don't give me that look; Malfoy's still a little git but he's got his head on straight and he's a pretty damn good Auror.\" There was a little gasp in response to Harry's curse, he looked to see Freya covering her mouth in a shocked manner:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"171\">\"Language, Mister Potter!\" she ordered sternly, before her face turned red and she looked away, \"Oh... uhm, er... sorry.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"172\">Harry looked at the girl for a long moment, trying to figure out something to say, mouth moving wordlessly. But the sight of the abashed child stumbling over her apology was enough to make anyone laugh, let alone Harry Potter. He chuckled, a deep, rich, musical sound that he could only muster in the presence of his Godson, Teddy, and other children. He had to admit, for a girl who had just lost her parents, Freya was taking it very well:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"173\">\"She sounds exactly like you, Hermione,\" Harry said to the honey-haired woman, who smiled lightly, and then he crouched to the preteen's level again. smiling. \"I'll keep my mouth as clean as possible, and I promise, if I ever swear in front of you again, I give you permission to wash my mouth out with soap.\" Freya looked up, a childish sense of awe etched into her features while Hermione and Ginny started to laugh, though Harry believed that was more due to the mental image of an eleven year-old washing out the Boy-Who-Lived's mouth as a mother would naughty child the two were likely picturing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"174\">He is about to get up when Freya says his name: \"Mr. Potter?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"175\">\"It's Harry; Mr. Potter makes me feel old,\" But just as Harry began to wave the girl away, she jumped towards him, wrapping the tall Auror in a tight embrace:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"176\">\"Thank you, thank you, thank you!\" She repeated over and over into his shoulder. Harry, obviously uncomfortable with being shown such gratitude, looks to the Granger and the Weasley for help, both of whom shake their heads with poisonously sweet smiles. Shooting Hermione a glare, Harry awkwardly patted Freya's back and said something about how he didn't really do all that much and how it was Ron and Helene that had saved her, rather than himself.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"177\">But the little girl would have none of that and simply hugged the young man tighter. \"I was so scared...\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"178\">\"But you're okay now,\" Harry replied, moving out of Freya's embrace so he could look her, \"And you'll be safe at Hogwarts.\" Freya nodded happily as Harry let her out of his embrace, after which she moved back and held Hermione's hand.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"179\">\"I'll take you back to your room, Miss Thompson,\" Hermione said to Freya, and then turned to Harry and Ginny, \"Would you two like to accompany us?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"180\">Ginny nodded, but Harry shook his head. \"I should really report to Stark and get to packing up my stuff, I'm practically on the next floo out of here. Apparently I get to see the New Irish Metre, so I'm not complaining, but still... I really should get going.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"181\">Hermione looked disappointed. \"Oh, okay, Harry. I'll see you later, then?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"182\">Harry playfully glanced at a non-existent watch on his right wrist. \"In a half a year? Yes.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"183\">\"Ron will go mental if he has to work without you for six months. And if they put Malfoy as DCI?\" Ginny says, smirking, \"How did that little bugger get to be an Auror?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"184\">\"Well,\" Harry replied in a mock-thoughtful manner, \"when your entire family's assets have been liquidated by the Ministry and your father and mother are forced to flee the country, one has to find a way to make some sort of money. Every man comes to a point like that in his life. Lucius decided to side with Voldemort, and Draco decided to fight on the side of the angels.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"185\">\"Doesn't make him one, though,\" Hermione retorted, keen on a little post-attack banter with her best friend.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"186\">Harry giave her a bemused look in return: \"Darling, how many of us do you think are&nbsp;<em>actually</em>&nbsp;angels?\" He questioned cynically.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"187\">Hermione smiled cheekily: \"You are,\" she said, and Ginny made a sound very similar to blowing a raspberry, causing Freya to let out a little giggle at the Auror's expense:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"188\">\"Angel my thrice-cursed arse,\" the redhead muttered cheerily.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"189\">\"I'm touched, Hermione,\" Harry snarked. \"Please marry me.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"190\">Hermione smiled and didn't respond as they reached Freya's room. \"Would you like to come in?\" Freya asked Harry, who shook his head:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"191\">\"I really should get go-\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"192\">\"Please?\" Freya pleaded, giving Harry her best puppy-dog eyes. Harry grumbled and nodded his assent while Hermione followed in and Ginny elected to wait outside. Once inside, Harry talked to Freya about school for a few minutes and what to expect on her first day, but found himself marveling at all the stuff in her room, which Hermione explained as the possessions Aurors recovered from Freya's home from her wand and school items to other personal effects. Hermione voiced her awe at how easily she could rebound from how much suffering she underwent, and Harry replied that Freya was a remarkable child. The girl bounced around the room, devouring books Hermione had gotten her, and Harry joked that Hermione seemed to be getting too attached to Freya:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"193\">\"Well, it looks like you've got someone attached to you, too,\" Hermione replied, indicating Ginny, whom patiently waited out the door.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"194\">\"I told you, some things are better left lost,\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"195\">Hermione stared at Harry incredulously, before he continued: \"Besides, I've found the perfect person for me.\" Harry smiles lightly, and Hermione raises an eyebrow, biding him go on, \"Well, he's smart-\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"196\">\"<em>He</em>?\" She asked, suddenly confused.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"197\">\"What?\" Harry questioned nonchalantly, enjoying taking the mickey out of his normally unflappable friend, \"Didn't expect the great Harry Potter to go the other way?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"198\">Hermione spluttered, trying to regain a sense of decorum. \"It's... I-uh... is that why-\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"199\">\"Yes, I broke up with Ginny because of him,\" Harry continued dreamily, \"he's a little bit short, but, hey, who isn't short compared to me? He's a metamorphmagus, he loves milk, and this April he'll turn five.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"200\">That left Hermione with a strange and fascinating face Harry had never seen on the woman before: one of complete and utter befuddlement: \"Five? Five years old? Harry...\" her mouth moves wordlessly for a moment, before it dawns on her and the honey-haired woman breaks out into peals of laughter, \"You're talking about Teddy aren't you?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"201\">\"Love of my life,\" Harry replied cheekily. Teddy Lupin was Harry's Godson, the son of his late friends Remus and Nymphadora Lupin, though everyone still called the woman Tonks even after she had married.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"202\">\"When are you next going to see him? I'd like to come with, after all, I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;his godmother.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"203\">Harry shrugged. \"I think I'll go tomorrow, before I head off to Liverpool.\" Hermione remained silent for a moment, before whispering, rather piteously, in a manner unbecoming of her:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"204\">\"Please visit often, won't you, Harry?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"205\">\"On my honor,\" he replied, giving her a salute and dropping his voice to a whisper, \"besides, who else will help me get over... my little problem?\" He waggled his eyebrows playfully. Hermione swatted at his arm:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"206\">\"Oh, you big oaf!\" She exclaimed, turning back to Freya, who gave Harry a Sherlock Holmes book, saying that he reminded her of Mister Holmes and that she wanted to give him a present as thanks. Hermione smiled, telling Freya to get some rest, and turned back to Harry:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"207\">\"I'll see you tomorrow, then?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"208\">\"Naturally,\" Harry replied, \"Goodbye, Hermione.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"209\">\"Have a good night!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"210\">Harry opened the door and met Ginny outside, as they walked out into the London air together, where she stopped and looked at Harry expectantly, but he told her to have a nice night and promptly apparated away to the Old Irish Metre.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"211\"><em>August 31, 2002. 9:00 PM</em><br /><em>Old Irish Metre, London, UK</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"212\">When Harry arrived, he barely took notice of many of the well-wishers lolling about the atrium of the building. He nodded lightly at Gwen, the receptionist, telling her that he was to meet Chief-Superintendent Stark. She looked about her schedule, nodded, and called for CS Stark. All the while, Harry could not shake the strange sense of deja vu he got from this, feeling as though he had gone through the same routine during his very first visit to The Circus Headquarters. After the customary goodbyes, Harry marches to the elevators, involuntarily looking up to make sure he hadn't been transported into the Twilight Zone and there was no large golden Conflict-Globe glaring at his from stories above. An elevator opened, Harry stepped in, and watched the outside scenery of the London Skyline slowly shift with his ever rising vantage point until Harry found himself on the sixth floor, where Stark's office happened to be.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"213\">Harry continued his torrid pace into the Office and sat down in his chair before Stark could even say anything. \"I assume this is about the Bulstrom Case, isn't it?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"214\">\"What the bloody hell else could it be?\" Walter Stark, an aging man with reddish-brown hair starting to go gray, asked angrily, looking rather miffed at Granath's 'best operative'. \"Look, Potter, I like you, and I like the work you do when you catch criminals... but you're too&nbsp;<em>bleeding</em>&nbsp;<em>reckless</em>! Merlin's beard, you go running around with your partner and an informant who is possibly a murderer, then disappear to God-knows-where for hours and then appear on a bench in the middle of Hyde Park! Sound reckless to you? Because it sure as bloody hell does to me!\"<em><br /></em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"215\">\"Well, excuse me while I go find myself a place to slit my wrists,\" Harry drawled, \"I&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;get your killer for you, didn't I?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"216\">\"Don't patronize me, Potter!\" Came back the angry bark, \"You broke with protocol, and I don't care if you defeated Voldemort or the devil himself, you&nbsp;<em>do not break with protocol</em>. Ever!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"217\">\"So you're relocating me to the NIM?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"218\">\"Until you prove you can solve Homicide Cases properly, until then, you're waging the war on drugs.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"219\">\"Great, waging the war that never ends,\" Harry spat snidely.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"220\">Stark drew back, collapsing into his high-backed chair. \"So, your blatant flaunting of the rules has gone too far too many times; I'm relocating you to Liverpool. We've got word from some agents in MI6, that know of the wizarding world, who say that we've seen an increase in Agilian production and sale, turning it into the drug capital of Northern England. And, to get you all smiley, there are rumors of Dark Wizards showing up all over the place that need catching.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"221\">But Harry wasn't listening. He stared at his superior in wide-eyed shock. He couldn't have said 'smiley' on purpose, could he? There are much better words to use than that: happy, giddy, so on and so forth; smiley is simply a strange term to use. Unless, of course, Stark was referring to Harry's new 'codename' of sorts in The Circus.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"222\">The elder man's lips drew upwards in a smile that left Harry with no doubt. This transfer was not petty vengeance for Harry's breaking protocol, but rather, a conscious move by The Circus to get him closer in hand. He wasn't sure what they wanted, but something told him that he should trust them if Stark was playing for their team; that man was not easily swayed or duped into believing an idiotic cause. But he'd have to test Stark first:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"223\">\"What can I expect?\" Harry questions suddenly; obviously meaning The Circus, but it could be easily mistaken as what he'd be doing at the NIM, just in case it was a massive coincidence.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"224\">Stark's smile grew even wider as he looked at Harry thoughtfully: \"Oh a few bruises and scrapes, nothing serious so long as they get you doing the job you're most suited for. We even got you a nice apartment with all the amenities, you'll just need to bring personal effects and toiletries.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"225\">Harry leaned back into his chair. That was not something Stark would say if he were truly being relocated to Liverpool for a couple of drug busts. There was no way he wasn't... Stark had to be Circus brass.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"226\">\"Am I excused?\" Harry questioned.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"227\">\"Go,\" Stark replied, the strange smile still on his face as Harry got up and exited the office.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"228\"><em>September 1st, 2002. 9:06 AM<br />King's Cross Station, London, UK</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"229\">Harry watched the muggles pass by him, and he was sure he saw a wizarding family or two as he passed onward to Platform Ten, where the train to Liverpool would be taking him. Harry knew that he could apparate there with little difficulty, but, for some reason, he wanted to experience this day in the muggle way, even if he carried all his shrunken belongings in a briefcase to make things a little bit easier. Harry had already visited Teddy with Hermione, taking turns playing with the four year-old and conversing quietly with Andromeda onlooking. Harry walked past Platform 8. Then Platform 9, and three pillars downwards, he caught eye of a brown-haired little girl surrounded by a coterie of Aurors. The girl, Freya Thompson, smiled and jumped and at him:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"230\">\"Hi, Mr. Potter!\" Freya exclaimed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"231\">\"Harry,\" he corrected gruffly; Freya nodded:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"232\">\"Harry. I'm going to Hogwarts today,\" her voice dropped to a whisper, \"I'm scared.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"233\">Harry chuckled. \"I was too, when I started. \"Just be yourself and try to talk to some people while you're on the train, you'll be making friends in no time.\" Freya shook her head:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"234\">\"I didn't have many friends...\" she started.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"235\">\"Well now's as good a time as any to start, wouldn't you say?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"236\">The little girl nodded happily, and it once again astounded Harry as to how resilient Freya could be. Sure, she was nervous, insecure, but no different than any other child getting ready to go away to Hogwarts. He briefly thought that if he had half the resilience this preteen girl had, Voldemort would have died at that graveyard in Little Hangleton, killed by Harry's sheer willpower, Horcruxes be damned! He told Freya, for some reason, he seemed to have just blurted it out, that if she ever got lonely, she could write him, to which the girl happily agreed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"237\">Soon, their time together was done with and Freya had to go on into Platform 9 3/4, and Harry moved onward to Platform Ten, but in that little eleven year-old, Harry saw something special. He couldn't place what it was that made the girl so very different in the long minutes between 9:12 and and 9:45, when he was supposed to leave.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"238\">But, as time passed, he understood why, thinking back to the moment he and Hermione had shared the day after Voldemort's fall. He saw people basked in the postwar glow, dancing and laughing and playing despite the tragedies that occurred over the year beforehand, and Harry felt nothing, no happiness, no peace, nothing at all.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"239\">But, now, he saw it. In a little, soon-to-be First Year, there was something to be appreciated. He still couldn't place what it was even after the train arrived, Harry just knew Freya shone like the sun rolling over the fog the day after the war ended, and he briefly thought that if he ever had a daughter, he'd want one like Freya.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"240\">The musing came and went, but the smile never left his face, even as he boarded the train off into his 'next great adventure'.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"margin: 5px 0px; height: 1px; border: 0px; background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 100%, 100% 100%, from(#ffffff), color-stop(0.1, #cbcbcb), color-stop(0.9, #cbcbcb), to(#ffffff)) #cbcbcb;\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" />\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"241\"><strong>A/N:</strong>&nbsp;Decent length, I suppose, but I guess it's a bit of a boring chapter if you're not into chapters built around character development. Next chapter, I hope, will be a bit more exciting, as Harry gets to Liverpool, learns more about his assignment with the Auror Department and meets his team, as well as getting his first 'official' call from The Circus.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"242\">For DotU fans, the next chapter will be up by next Sunday.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"243\">Chapter Notes:</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"244\">83 kilograms is about 182 lbs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"245\">Football, as in soccer for Americans.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"246\">Harry's Zeitgeist Phenomena will come back to haunt him, and now you've got an explanation for his drug and cigarette use. Hermione, on the other hand, will throw he entire weight behind trying to fix Harry.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"247\">There's a pleading edge to Hermione's request that Harry visit often for a reason</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"248\">Freya's comparisons to Hermione and Harry's to Sherlock Holmes are not without merit.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"249\">For all Ron fans, he's not going to appear very much in the next few chapters, which is a shame, because I really like writing him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"250\">Also, note, that while this is ultimately an H/Hr, and Ginny's been acting a bit snide, it's no more than one would expect from a jilted lover. She's actually quite civil compared to most. Ron is much the same, he will not like where Harry and Hermione are headed, but that's no cause for him to suddenly turn head and become a pureblood racist who claims that he has a right to Hermione and becomes a, for lack of a better term, douche. No. Just no. For all those who love bashing, Ron/Ginny will get mad, they'll get jealous, but under no circumstances will there be any Ron/Ginny the Death Eater-ifiying to get Harry and Hermione together. Truthfully, you might even find those two more sympathetic than Harry and Hermione in the way these relationships shake out.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"251\">In any case, thank you for reading, please review, and above all, I hope you enjoyed!</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"252\">Geist.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"253\">P.S.

The long-standing tradition of running about madly and tossing whatever they could grasp into their over-flowing trunks had been abolished.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"1\">\"Feels weird, doesn't it?\" Ron asked.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"2\">\"What? Getting it done with more than five minutes to spare?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"3\">Ron laughed. \"That too. But I meant going&nbsp;<em>home</em>, to the&nbsp;<em>Burrow!&nbsp;</em>I barely saw it before Mum was screeching at me to get ready,\" He smiled fondly, not at all upset about it. \"I'd forgotten how loud she could get.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"4\">They were in the Room of Requirement and had more time to speak to each other without Snape and Dumbledore wanting to discuss strategies and tactics, or Hermione wanting to discuss the Philosopher's Stone. They didn't begrudge either, but the two hours they had to completely relax stretched out before them like an early Christmas gift.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"5\">\"Do you think it was stupid?\" Harry asked suddenly. \"To give that book to Hermione?\" They'd ordered a very rare copy of&nbsp;<em>Memories Unbound&nbsp;</em>as a gift for their friend, and Harry had second-guessed the decision (even though he'd been the one to think of it) ever since.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"6\">\"Nah, I've told you before,\" Ron said lazily. \"She'll never believe it. You were right, mate, it sets the stage for when we tell her the truth. She'll think it's a load of rubbish.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"7\">Harry nodded. \"She'll like the Chocolate Frogs, at least.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"8\">\"And not all of it was something she'd never believe,\" said Ron. \"Some of it wasn't fairy-tale stuff. It had an entire chapter on Occlumency, even.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"9\">Harry looked over at Ron. His already long legs stretched out toward the fire, and he had his arms behind his head. He looked completely relaxed, but Harry knew his best mate well, and thus knew the tell-tale signs of anxiety: the occasional scratching of his long nose, the way he tapped his foot. Nothing too obvious, but Harry knew. He also knew what bothered him. Harry was not the only one who knew Ron that well, and they were going to be in the company of his family.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"10\">\"Just stay relaxed,\" Harry advised. \"Ginny's been able to do it all these months without any sort of problem.\" At least she hadn't mentioned it. It'd be just like Ginny to run into a spot of trouble the size of London and not see fit to tell them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"11\">Ron snorted, \"Like Ginny'd tell us.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"12\">\"If it was something major, I'm sure she would,\" Harry murmured, despite the fact that he'd been thinking along the same lines as Ron. \"I can't wait to see her. She pointed out to me that we haven't been apart for this long since the Burrow was destroyed.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"13\">\"You'll see her in about ten hours,\" Ron said absently. \"We'll have to find some way to get away from the Burrow, just the three of us. Hopefully tonight. And several more times over Christmas.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"14\">\"Isn't this the most maddening thing?\" Harry asked. \"We've spent so many years alone, without anyone, and now we're worried about getting away just the three of us?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"15\">Ron laughed. \"It's up there with one of the best feelings in the world.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"16\">\"Ron,\" Harry said seriously after a while. \"You do think we're doing the right thing with the Philosopher's Stone? Letting it all play out the same way?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"17\">Ron eyed him. \"You're having doubts?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"18\">Harry was, but he had not told Ron of his misgivings. \"I'm afraid,\" He admitted. Then, when Ron looked shocked, he waved his hand abruptly. \"Not of all the obstacles, dolt. I'm worried about Voldemort. What if he tries to use Legilimency on me?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"19\">\"Snape's been training you in Occlumency again, isn't he?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"20\">\"Yeah,\" Harry admitted. \"I'm a bit better, but not by much, and I've got to be perfect before I meet him. Imagine if he found out everything? I've got a lot of dangerous secrets, you know, and being from the future is just one of them. The Horcruxes, for one. He could easily hide them all again. We've got the tiara, and the locket is fairly safe at Grimmauld Place&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"21\">\"What about the cup?\" Ron said shrewdly. \"He can't exactly go break into Gringotts again. At least, he can't break into the Lestranges' vault.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"22\">\"We did,\" Harry pointed out quietly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"23\">\"We did because Hermione impersonated Bellatrix,\" Ron replied. \"Plus, I'll bet he wouldn't think of the dragon.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"24\">\"I'm still worried,\" Harry said stubbornly. \"It doesn't matter about the diary Horcrux. Tom Riddle can find out all he wants before I kill him again. And even if he finds out when he resurrects himself would not be the end of the world. But we've only destroyed one Horcrux; and I don't want to change everything too much. What if we can't find out way to victory?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"25\">\"Keep up with the Occlumency,\" was the only comfort Ron seemed able to give.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"26\">HPHPHPHPHPHP</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"27\">The first month or so at Hogwarts had been very emotional for Harry. Seeing everyone alive and well again, untainted by the darkness that was to come, had brought a lump to his throat and tears to his eyes many a time during the first weeks. It had taken several weeks for him to adjust to this reality, one in which Harry was once again a first year. He rather thought that his former ten year old self would be completely incapable of experiencing this rather mixed bouquet of emotions: fear, joy, celebration, and guilt. But he had a better handle on it now; his body and mind had adjusted to the differences and the miracles.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"28\">Thus Harry was relieved to note that he was not in any danger of doing anything suspicious or embarrassing (such as bursting into tears) during the car ride home from the platform.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"29\">Arthur Weasley, tall, thin, and balding, picked them up in the old Ford Anglia. After a quick introduction to Harry, and a stern refusal to make use of the car's Invisibility Booster and powers of flight, he led them out to the car. The rowdy Weasley boys made short work of hefting their trunks into the magically enhanced boot, and piled into the backseat. Harry was not surprised to find that Percy claimed the front by right of the eldest son present.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"30\">London was sodden and gray, but the atmosphere in the car was lively and loud.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"31\">\"&mdash;And then Penelope Clearwater, she's another prefect, you know, said\" &ndash; Percy said from the front seat.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"32\">\"But where does Lee expect we'll&nbsp;<em>find&nbsp;</em>it?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"33\">\"No idea, George, he's off his rocker if he thinks Mum'll let us go to Knockturn Alley.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"34\">\"How was your term, boys?\" Arthur said loudly after several minutes of this. Harry could see his eyes in the mirror, so he was certain the older man was talking to him and Ron.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"35\">\"It was fun, Dad, I&nbsp;<em>love&nbsp;</em>Hogwarts!\" Ron said enthusiastically.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"36\">\"Even if it got to a bit of a rocky start?\" Arthur's eyes twinkled. \"Don't think your mother's forgotten about it, Ron. Speaking of the Confuzzle Draught,\" Arthur looked sternly at the twins. \"Your mother suspects that you two were the ones to give it to them.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"37\">\"We didn't!\" George said immediately.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"38\">\"Only because we didn't think of it,\" Fred said fairly. \"It was pretty brilliant.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"39\">\"I wish I could've been there,\" George added. \"If only to see the expression on that old bat's face.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"40\">\"George,\" Arthur warned.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"41\">\"Sorry,\" George looked quite unabashed. \"<em>Professor&nbsp;</em>Old Bat.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"42\">Even Arthur laughed, and Percy cracked a grin, although Harry noticed that the older boy tried to hide it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"43\">Harry decided to speak up. \"Percy helped us with our potions work after that, since Professor Snape was so angry.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"44\">\"Yeah,\" Ron put in. \"If Percy hadn't given us those tips about the common ingredients and whatnot, me and Harry would've lost even more points for Gryffindor.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"45\">Percy sat up straighter. \"Just doing my job, Ron. Prefects help the other students.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"46\">\"Don't pretend that the fact that I'm your favorite brother had nothing to do with it,\" Ron teased. Harry laughed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"47\">It had been a plan of theirs to attempt to include Percy. When they'd first begun to scheme, Ron had been struck by an idea.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"48\"><em>It was summer, and the residents of the cottage over-looking the river had changed almost completely in the last few months. Kreacher was simply delighted, and bustled around preparing meals that did not go completely unappreciated. Ron's appetite especially had returned with a vengeance.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"49\"><em>\"Mmm,\" He moaned, chewing a bite of sandwich. \"The elf's cooking gets better by the day. We ought to give him another Black family heirloom.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"50\"><em>Ginny looked exasperated but amused. \"Ron, if you can stop thinking about food for just one second, we've got to talk about the family. Namely Percy.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"51\"><em>\"What about Percy?\" Ron asked. Apparently he'd not been listening to the other two for the last five minutes.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"52\"><em>\"We don't want him to support the Ministry again,\" Harry explained. \"We know he'll come back in the end, but&hellip;\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"53\"><em>\"Well, I don't know how to do that, but we could just treat him better,\" Ron said after taking another bite. \"We always treated him like the bastard of the family, except Mum and Dad. He was always pompous, yeah, but I regret a lot of the stuff we said over the years.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"54\"><em>\"Very insightful, Ron,\" Ginny smiled. \"It may not make a difference, but&hellip;\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"55\"><em>\"At least he'll know we love him,\" Ron said. \"Always and always.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"56\">Thus Harry and Ron had gone to Percy every once in a while throughout their first term at Hogwarts. Not with anything big or earth-shattering. But they asked him a question here and there, which Percy responded to with a surprising degree of warmth. Despite the prior knowledge of the subject, his answers about potions and transfiguration (neither of which Ron or Harry was particularly skilled at, then or now) were helpful.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"57\">Harry wondered about the changes they were making, and felt reasonably confident that they were for the better. Percy's loss had been devastating, most especially to Ron and Ginny. They'd been angry with him for years when he'd chosen to stand with the Ministry, even after Harry had been proven right. It was just barely after he had reunited with his family that Percy had been killed defending his mother from an attack from behind. Even if Percy chose to side with the Ministry again, Harry thought that he'd feel able to come back sooner.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"58\">\"What has the two of you so quiet?\" Fred asked suddenly. Startled, Harry looked out the window, and realized that dusk had fallen while he'd been lost in his thoughts.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"59\">Ron moaned. \"Thinking about Mum, and all the words she'll have for me about the Confuzzle Draught and the troll.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"60\">George grinned evilly. \"Better start getting your affairs in order.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"61\">\"You're not like to live long once Mum gets her hands on you.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"62\">\"Your mother is very proud of you, Ron,\" Arthur interjected. \"But she is a bit angry, yes.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"63\">Percy swiveled around in his seat and grinned at Ron. \"Better get started now, the Burrow's only a kilometer away.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"64\">Sure enough, they were driving past the small village of Ottery-St.-Catchpole, and Harry could see the orchard that marked the boundary of the land the Burrow sat upon and hid their small Quidditch pitch from view. It was a beautiful sight, Harry thought. The sun was setting behind the mountains, and made the snow that covered the ground and trees glow red, orange, and yellow. Soon enough, an even more beautiful sight came into view: the Burrow. It was just as crooked, ramshackle, and beloved as ever.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"65\">Harry got out of the car, retrieved his trunk, and gazed around. The old Wellington boots still guarded the backdoor, there was a clear path to the Quidditch pitch (Ginny obviously couldn't stop herself from flying), and little tracks in the snow that belonged to the many garden gnomes that lurked around the Burrow because of Arthur's kind heart.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"66\">\"I expect Molly's got dinner ready,\" Arthur told his sons. \"Be sure to take off your outer things in the hall &ndash; you know how your mother gets.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"67\">\"It's just&nbsp;<em>snow</em>,\" Fred and George complained in unison. \"What's a little bit of water?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"68\">Arthur ignored them, but turned to smile kindly at Harry and squeezed Ron's shoulder affectionately. \"Welcome to the Burrow, Harry.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"69\">HPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHP</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"70\"><em>They were lucky that Arthur Weasley had had the presence of mind to send his Patronus to his youngest son the night the Death Eaters attacked. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had been sitting in their tent, barely speaking. It had been a long year of hiding, and without any sort of sign of moving forward, they'd taken to snapping at each other. Not having any word from the outside world had not helped either.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"71\"><em>\"Honestly, Ron, you shouldn't just expect me to do all the cleaning,\" Hermione said irritably. She was polishing her wand for what seemed like the fifteenth time in as many days.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"72\"><em>Ron was about to retort when they were astonished to see the unmistakable, misty form of Arthur's Patronus coalesce in front of him.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"73\"><em>\"Burrow under attack,\" it said, and vanished.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"74\"><em>The three had never taken down the tent so quickly. It was packed within Hermione's beaded bag within a minute. They grasped hands and Disapparated.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"75\"><em>For one moment, all Harry could do was look on in horror as what seemed like a dozen figures in black robes dueled with five red-heads&hellip; including two witches.&nbsp;</em>Ginny.&nbsp;<em>He ran, and started firing jinxes and hexes at any Death Eater he could, while careful not to hit any of the Weasleys. He took one down with&nbsp;</em>Sectusempra &ndash;&nbsp;<em>later, he recognized the man as Yaxley.

Ron was yelling, Hermione was shouting.

Harry felt blindly &ndash; his glasses were hanging off one ear &ndash; for Ginny's hand. He finally found it, righted his glasses, and thought with all his might of the front step of his dead godfather's house: the very last place he wanted to be, and the only place that seemed relatively safe.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"90\"><em>The Burrow erupted in flames, and he felt a stab of grief in his heart for the place he'd had the closest thing he'd had to a childhood.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"91\">\"Oi! Wake up!\" Ron's voice interrupted the dream of the Burrow burning, for which Harry was grateful. \"What were you dreaming of?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"92\">\"The Burrow,\" Harry muttered, reaching for his glasses.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"93\">\"Not surprised,\" Ron said after a moment. \"I can't get it out of my mind either.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"94\">It was the third day of the holiday, and Harry found himself both frustrated and elated by turns. It was just as wonderful as he remembered, this place and these people. Mrs. Weasley had been kind and loving &ndash; after she'd scolded them both for the troll. She'd been mollified when they explained that they only went to find Hermione. There was never a dull moment with any of Ron's siblings. They were loud and merry, especially around this time of year.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"95\">Harry could hardly stop himself from staring at Ginny. It reminded him a bit of the time he'd spent at the Burrow during the summer between his first and second year. Only this time, they both blushed &ndash; something that Harry fervently hoped the twins did not notice. It wasn't out of shyness, though, but out of strong feelings that could not be expressed any other way.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"96\">\"Listen,\" Ron broke into his reverie. \"I've got an idea for getting away with Ginny. You've got your Cloak, right?\" Harry held it up silently. \"Surprised I didn't think of this before.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"97\">HPHPHPHPHPHP</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"98\">Despite his fitful rest, Harry found himself wide awake as he and Ron, under the Invisibility Cloak, tip-toed to Ginny's room and opened the door without making a sound. Ron's brilliant plan had included nothing more than the Invisibility Cloak and the surety that everyone else was sleeping. It was past midnight, and the small room was lit only with the light of the moon. A small figure huddled under the blankets. Harry walked tentatively over to the sleeping Ginny. He gazed down at her for a moment, drinking in the sight of her.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"99\">Ron nudged him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"100\">He bent over and whispered, \"Ginny. Wake up.\" Behind him, he heard Ron mutter, \"<em>Muffliato</em>.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"101\">She murmured and sighed a little, but didn't awaken. Harry brushed her hair away from her face and pressed a small kiss on her lips. Her eyes flew open. \"Harry&hellip;\" She yawned and grinned at him. For a moment he couldn't say anything, but smiled back rather stupidly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"102\">\"We did it,\" she whispered. \"We did!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"103\">They all grinned at each other, and Harry felt almost ridiculously happy. Harry sat down next to her, and she scooted over, making room. He took her hand and gripped it tight.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"104\">\"So,\" She said. \"Tell me everything!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"105\">And they did. It didn't take very long. They lingered over the particularly humorous moments with Snape while she laughed delightedly. And she was in stitches while they described the fight with the troll, which had been made more difficult than they'd remembered since they had few usable spells in their arsenal.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"106\">\"Oh, but I'm glad Hermione's all right!\" Ginny stopped laughing after a moment. \"But tell me about that prophecy! I've been perishing of curiosity for ages.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"107\">They told her, and her face fell. \"I thought it might be something like that. I finally dragged the truth out of Mum when Ron asked if Harry could stay,\" for some reason she looked uncomfortable and a little worried. \"Mum&hellip; she wasn't sure if Harry should.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"108\">\"What?\" Ron said loudly. \"Since when&hellip;?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"109\">\"Well&hellip;\" Ginny said slowly. \"The only bit that anyone knows about &ndash; although everyone seems to know that there is more to it than that &ndash; talks about the terrible power. That wasn't in the old version, and I have to wonder what it means. Keep in mind&hellip; Harry, no one thinks that Voldemort is going to come back. Mum and Dad talk about him as if he's dead forever. What people are worried about is the fact that you apparently have this terrible power, it 'killed' Voldemort, and now they're a little frightened of you. Mum said that about five years ago there was an article in the Daily Prophet that questioned whether or not you'd be a good wizard or an evil one.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"110\">The words took awhile for Harry to process. It had seemed funny in Dumbledore's office on their first day of classes that anyone would think that he'd be evil. It was not funny anymore at all. If Mrs. Weasley had not wanted him&hellip;</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"111\">\"What does Mum think?\" Ron asked quietly. He had sat down at Ginny's feet while she'd talked. \"And why didn't she want Harry around?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"112\">\"Well&hellip;\" Ginny paused. \"You know how she is. You mustn't think that she blamed Harry for what happened your first day. She blamed you just as much, Ron.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"113\">\"I&nbsp;<em>did&nbsp;</em>steal the Dungbombs,\" Ron said modestly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"114\">Ginny giggled. \"True. She had to have known that a child with no Wizarding background &ndash; don't look at me like that, Harry, she thinks all you've known since you were one are the Dursleys &ndash; could pull that. And she came around when she heard about the Confuzzle Draught&hellip; but I reckon she thought that you wouldn't have spoken up if you hadn't been with Harry.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"115\">\"Which is true,\" Harry added fairly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"116\">\"Indeed,\" Ginny agreed. \"But with the article and the weeks and weeks of detention and the troll&hellip; She's wondering, that's all.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"117\">Harry sat in thought, rubbing the pad of his thumb on Ginny's palm. He remembered with perfect clarity the warmth that Mrs. Weasley had always felt for him. She'd loved him since practically the first meeting, even though he seemed to lead her children into danger quite a bit. The Ministry battle, for instance, when Sirius had died. She'd never by word or deed told him (or any of her children, he thought) that she blamed him for these dangerous situations he seemed to find himself in. He'd wondered, during his two weeks of depression after that particular battle and before Dumbledore came to collect him, if Mrs. Weasley would be angry with him for taking Ginny and Ron along. When he'd shown up at the Burrow, though, those doubts had vanished.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"118\">\"Listen,\" he said. \"I reckon that your mum thinks that I'm a bit dangerous to have as a friend.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"119\">\"Harry&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"120\">But Harry stopped Ginny. \"She's right. You know she is. I'm not saying that &ndash; for the most part the &ndash; I don't think I've played casually with your lives. At least I've never meant to.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"121\">\"We know,\" Ron rolled his eyes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"122\">\"Don't,\" Harry said. \"This is serious. I'm not going off on one of my guilt induced pleadings for you guys to stay away from me. I'd like to think that I'm beyond that&hellip; kind of. Not that I want you to stay away from me, but remembering what we lost&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"123\">\"We feel the same way, Harry,\" Ginny squeezed his hand. \"As I recall, none of us trusted Snape, and we all knew that Dumbledore trusted him beyond reason. It was a mistake we all made together.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"124\">\"Yeah,\" Harry sighed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"125\">\"But not this time,\" Ron told him. \"We know what's going on.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"126\">\"Except for this 'terrible power' I'm supposed to have,\" Harry said. \"I don't get why that changed. I know that my greatest weapon is love. And I know that's what defeated him the first time. But what if, this time, it's different?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"127\">They sat in silence for a time, thinking and trying to come up with an easy solution that would explain the ramifications of the different prophecy. It was a comfortable silence, for the most part. The fact that Mrs. Weasley did not immediately trust Harry was not something that concerned Ron and Ginny too much. And Harry hoped, by the time the truth was out, that any mistrust would be obliterated. But it made him slightly wary, and slightly less secure.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"128\">\"I worry about when it comes out that I'm a Parselmouth,\" Harry said finally. \"If people are so worried about that prophecy, and unsure of my motives, won't it deepen the misgivings?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"129\">Ginny looked thoughtful. \"As I recall, it couldn't be any worse. And I'm thinking it'll be better, since Dumbledore knows everything.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"130\">\"And Harry'll take care of everything with the Basilisk in the end,\" Ron interjected. \"That'll count for something.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"131\">\"I do wonder who wrote that article,\" Ginny admitted. \"It seemed like one of Rita Skeeter's pieces, but it was apparently anonymous. I can't see her writing something that inflammatory without having her byline on it. I wonder if it was a Death Eater, actually.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"132\">\"That would make sense. Even if some of them don't know exactly what steps Voldemort took to insure his continued existence, I'll bet they'd leap at a chance to discredit me,\" Harry agreed. \"Lucius Malfoy, for one.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"133\">Ron sighed. \"I'll be glad when we tell Hermione, that's for sure. I'll bet she'll tell us right off where we're wrong and such.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"134\">\"Speaking of Hermione&hellip;\" Ginny began slyly, and Ron flushed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"135\">\"Quiet, you,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"136\">Ginny opened her eyes wide innocently, but neither one of them were fooled. She was bent on tormenting her brother for a bit, Harry realized. \"I just hope that you're being&nbsp;<em>nice&nbsp;</em>to her now.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"137\">Ron grinned, though his ears were still red. \"I am.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"138\">\"They still argue,\" Harry felt compelled to say. \"But it isn't mean.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"139\">\"I can't imagine Ron and Hermione without the arguing,\" Ginny said ruefully. \"It's like foreplay for them.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"140\">Ron chose that moment to leave. \"I'm going to bed,\" he announced, standing up and striding to the door. He stood with his hand on the knob and looked back at them. \"Don't stay up too late, children,\" he said gleefully.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"141\">\"I'll be up in a few minutes,\" Harry promised, though he didn't want to. He was exhausted, and he knew that if he stayed too long and fell asleep it would be disastrous. He was grateful for the time alone with Ginny, and as soon as Ron shut the door behind him, he leaned over and gave her a soft kiss.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"142\">She sighed. \"Hard to believe that we'll have nothing more than kisses for the next few years.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"143\">\"Don't argue,\" Harry said sternly. \"You're lucky it isn't longer.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"144\">She nestled up against him. \"I know. This body,\" she looked down on herself dubiously. \"It's hard to reconcile a grown woman's desire with a body that hasn't gone through puberty. Don't get me wrong, Harry, the desire hasn't gone away&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"145\">\"I know,\" Harry kissed her hair. It still smelled like flowers. \"I do know. I'm relieved that I have no desire to do anything besides a few kisses. I'd be rather worried if I did. But when I look at you, I can see the woman that you'll become.&nbsp;<em>That's&nbsp;</em>what makes me want the years go by fast.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"146\">\"I know,\" Ginny grinned impishly at him. \"I'm glad I talked you down to fourteen.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"147\">\"That's still young,\" Harry pointed out.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"148\">\"But only in body, Harry, like I told you. Sometimes I think that the dangers of sex at the age of fourteen are mental and emotional, rather than physical. Plenty of women throughout the ages have been married by the time they have their first cycle.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"149\">\"I know,\" Harry said. \"Fourteen is soon enough, I think. Your body will be physically mature, and we don't have to worry about the mental and emotional aspect of it. I love you, Ginny.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"150\">\"Always and always, Harry,\" she sighed. Harry knew that she was fading fast, and that she needed her sleep. But he continued to stroke her hair. Intimacy did not have to be about sex, as far as he was concerned. It was about the love he felt for this woman that he had never felt for anyone else, and it translated over to everything he did. They had saved each other from the agony of the first years, and the desperation of the last four. He'd love her forever. This quiet moment was no less full of love.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"151\">He finally left, leaving Ginny peacefully sleeping. She'd fallen asleep in his arms as she had so many times before. He smiled, and left.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"152\">HPHPHPHPHPHPHPHP</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"153\">\"Harry!\" Ron yelled. \"Wake up! It's Christmas!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"154\">Harry jumped out of bed, not even fully awake. He grabbed for his wand, realized where he was, and lay back down with a groan. \"<em>Must&nbsp;</em>you, Ron?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"155\">He saw a blurry figure of a red-headed boy, grinning from ear to ear. \"Get up, Harry, I'll bet the others are waiting for us. We've got to keep up appearances.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"156\"><em>Appearances, my arse,&nbsp;</em>Harry thought. Unbelievably, Ron was&nbsp;<em>still&nbsp;</em>thrilled by Christmas morning, even though he knew exactly what each of the presents held. Come to think of it, though, Harry found a well of excitement inside himself. It spurred him on to pull robes over his underpants, and he was not far behind Ron when he thundered down the stairs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"157\">The tree was just as lavishly decorated as all the other times at the Burrow. Harry gazed suspiciously at the tree-topper. Unable to discern whether or not it was a gnome, he turned toward the modest pile of presents that had his name on it. Only he and Percy were slow about opening their presents. Ron, the twins, and Ginny were ripping packages apart with their enthusiasm. Wrapping paper flew everywhere while Mr. and Mrs. Weasley looked on with fond despair.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"158\">\"Mmm,\" Ron said. \"Chocolate frogs from Hermione!\" He held them up in victory, while Harry laughed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"159\">\"I've got the same from her,\" Harry said. \"I'll be able to build my collection!\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"160\">\"I'll give you any of my repeats,\" Ron assured him. \"My collection's almost complete, but I always get loads of extras. I think I've got about ten of Dumbledore, he's the most common.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"161\">\"Thanks, Ron,\" Harry beamed at him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"162\">The day was spent with such a level of frivolity and fun that Harry almost felt light-headed. After everyone had finished opening their gifts, they immediately put on their Weasley sweaters. All except Harry; he hadn't received one this year, but the wariness and unease Harry had felt when they'd spoken in Ginny's room were muted. Harry could wait for Mr. and Mrs. Weasley to trust him. Besides, Mrs. Weasley simply might not have had time to make him a sweater. Then, after a large, delicious breakfast that lasted almost two hours, they all marched outside to have a serious snowball battle. When they came back in, flushed from the cold and arguing heartily about who won, mugs of steaming hot chocolate awaited them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"163\">\"This is delicious, Mrs. Weasley,\" Harry said enthusiastically. \"Thank you for having me.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"164\">If he hadn't been watching her so closely, he would have missed the doubt that flickered across her plump, kind face. \"You're welcome, Harry.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"165\"><em>I can't expect her to immediately trust me,&nbsp;</em>Harry thought later, lying awake in bed with only Ron's loud snores for company.&nbsp;<em>It isn't fair.&nbsp;</em>But when he remembered the words she'd spoken to him the night they found out that Remus and Dora Lupin had been found dead alongside their small son Teddy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"166\"><em>Harry sat in the kitchen at Grimmauld Place with grief weighing heavy on his heart. He was alone in the darkened room. Ron and Hermione had disappeared hours ago, and he suspected that Hermione had cried herself to sleep and Ron had been there to comfort her. Ginny also was sleeping in the next room. She'd sat with him and held his hand for hours without saying a word, but exhaustion had eventually overcome her, and Harry had quietly withdrawn.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"167\"><em>\"Harry,\" Mrs. Weasley said softly. She said, \"Lumos,\" and her wand flickered and caused the room to brighten by a degree.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"168\"><em>He turned to look at her, and could no longer keep the tears at bay. She enfolded him into a warm embrace and held him while he cried, heart-broken.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"169\"><em>\"We'll get through this,\" she murmured.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"170\"><em>But Harry had a hard time believing it. Remus Lupin, the last true Marauder, was gone, and with him, the last link to the father he'd never known. And Dora's life snuffed out too, charming, clumsy Dora with a smile that could cheer up almost anyone. Small Teddy, not even two years old, killed before he could really live, Harry's godson.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"171\"><em>\"Mrs. Weasley,\" Harry said finally. He withdrew, and she sat in the chair beside him. \"Do you really think I can do this?\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"172\"><em>\"I know you will,\" she answered immediately. \"I've watched you grow up, Harry. I know you. If anyone can do it, you can. And you won't stop until you've defeated You-Know-Who.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"173\"><em>\"Are you sure?\" Harry felt a little humiliated when his voice came out very small. He almost sounded like a child, not almost twenty years old.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"174\"><em>\"I have faith in it,\" she said. \"So does the rest of the family, and anyone who knows you. You'll defeat him. Unless I miss my guess, you're the only one who can. Not,\" she said ruefully and waved the hand not holding the lit wand, \"that I know the full contents of the prophecy. But you're a truly remarkable wizard, Harry. And I think I've known, on some level, that you'd be the one to defeat You-Know-Who. I think I've known since you rescued Ginny from the Chamber, and maybe even before that. Maybe I've known it since I received a certain letter from Hogwarts saying that you and my son rescued a girl you barely tolerated from a troll. You're our best hope. It must be such a burden, but I know you're up to the task. There's never been any question at all, in my mind&hellip;\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"175\">But now she&nbsp;<em>was&nbsp;</em>questioning, Harry knew it. He didn't know how to prove to her that he was as far from being another Dark Lord as was possible. They couldn't tell her the secret; Dumbledore's portrait had expressly warned him not to tell anyone besides himself and Professor Snape for as long as he could. Harry had made the mistake of not trusting him before, and he would not do it again.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"176\">He eased into anxious dreams in which people were talking about him in mutters behind closed doors, and he wandered through a huge house, and he could hear the people he loved, but whenever he turned to look for them they weren't there. He cried like a baby, and eventually he looked down at himself and realized that he&nbsp;<em>was&nbsp;</em>a baby, and he was all alone and bundled snugly in knitted blanket decorated with a W. But then Professor McGonagall came and told him that he couldn't have the blanket; she took it away, and he was left alone and naked, crying on the floor.</p>\r\n<p style=\"max-height: 999999px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px;\" data-paragraphnumber=\"177\">He awoke to the familiar feeling of his scar prickling.</p>",
